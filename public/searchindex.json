Countless events became entangled, giving birth to new occurrences. I also realized that it\u0026rsquo;s all just a complex web of interactions involving multiple events triggered by different individuals. So, we find ourselves here due to the actions of various people, including my own, and everything has simply accumulated.\nAnyway, today we bring to you, Dr. @Brian ji! (he is real doctor not phd one :P)\nI met Brian Ji in a mutual Twitter group chat, and as always, I started asking silly questions. Not only was he nice enough to answer them all, but he also DMed me, saying that I can ask him questions whenever I want. Even my teachers haven\u0026rsquo;t entertained the idea of their students asking silly questions.\nHe lives in Las Vegas. Also, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t consume any seed oils. I was blown away when I learned about it.\nI normally meet a lot of cool anonymous users on Twitter, but the first genuinely cool person with a profile picture of himself. He used to collect basketball cards when he was a kid. Did I mention that he is a doctor? The Indian shaadi market will go nuts for him.\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join?\nMy profile says I joined March 2015, but I probably didn’t start really using Twitter until summer/fall 2016.\nOrigin of your username/handle? (iff)\nSeems pretty self-evident\nHow did you come across tpot?\nNot sure to be honest, don’t think I intentionally became a part of it. Was just interacting with various accounts and becoming mutuals with them and then at some point we became tpot.\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account?\nThat honor goes to my brother from another mother @varunramg. Also @pajeetbateman though sadly he is no longer with us.\nHobbies?\nHiking, reading, weightlifting, cooking, linguistics. Recently started taking dance classes which has been fun. *Based*\nProfession?\nPhysician, specifically neurologist. Though I do telemedicine now that doesn’t involve seeing patients (if you listen to the podcast episode I have pinned on my profile I go into more details regarding exactly what I do).\nWhat is your favourite breakfast?\nMy standard breakfast is usually just eggs and coffee. In terms of favorites however I do love Scandinavian and Japanese breakfasts (there’s something about having fish in the morning that hits the spot).\nA dish you can never get enough of?\nSushi and yakiniku\nAre you blocked by lex?\nLast I checked, no. Somebody actually put me on a list called “Not yet blocked by Lex”.\nWho is your favourite anime waifu/ fav actress/actor?\n**Robert Downey Jr.** What is the secret to your bangers? **I just post and let the universe do with it what it will.** Favourite movie? (Any top 5) * **The Matrix** * **Lost in Translation** * **As Good As It Gets** * **John Wick 4** * **Parallels** any 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen? * **1er Gaou by Magic System** * **Wakarimasen by MIYACHI** * **Habibi by Ricky Rich \u0026amp; ARAM Mafia** * **Aitvaar by Jaz Dhami** * **SLR by Lupe Fiasco** any kinda sports you follow? **Not much of a sports guy** The last meme that made you chuckle? **Can’t recall exactly, but likely was something posted by @SeedOilDsrspctr** An image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence? We are eternally grateful to Brian ji for giving us the time and answering all the questions. We wish him all the best for all his future endeavours. Hope he gets to tour India and gets married, soon.\nBrian ji will accompany you in Las Vegas if you subscribe\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/deba/","title":"Humans of TPOT: Deba and West Bengal Politics","description":"this is meta description","date":"April 4, 2022","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/hotpot-banner_hufc1834b770d74eac5a2d8844db0b70a2_109861_420x0_resize_q90_h2_lanczos.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"140\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/hotpot-banner_hufc1834b770d74eac5a2d8844db0b70a2_109861_420x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpeg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/hotpot-banner_hufc1834b770d74eac5a2d8844db0b70a2_109861_100x100_fill_q90_h2_lanczos_smart1.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/hotpot-banner_hufc1834b770d74eac5a2d8844db0b70a2_109861_100x100_fill_q90_lanczos_smart1.jpeg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"tech-people, tpot","tags":"blog, twitter","content":"You might have read the tweets where I mentioned that things have been slow here, slower than usual.

He\u0026rsquo;s a nice lad. I recently broke his trust by spreading disinformation about Bollywood. From what I\u0026rsquo;ve gathered talking to him, he\u0026rsquo;s a hardworking person.\nHis mission is to \u0026lsquo;colonize\u0026rsquo; the UK.\nWhen I interacted with him, it felt like we were already friends. On the contrary, now that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about it, I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about him. I saw a video of him dancing, if that counts as getting to know each other.\nHe has traveled all over India for holidays and vacations, and he enjoys rock climbing. He\u0026rsquo;s also reading \u0026lsquo;Jujutsu Kaisen\u0026rsquo;, and that is all I could figure out from his profile on X.\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join?\nI think around feb 21 i got logged out of my og account and so decided to make this anon one.\nOrigin of your username/handle? (iff)\nThe kid in me always was fascinated by cool sounding names so I just made something up. Whats funny is I managed to not forget it haha\nHow did you come across tpot?\nNot really sure tbh, but i’ve followed telt and cokane since a long while, unironic too. Oh also I think vg followed me very very early on and then I think that was enough for me to start following anons haha\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account?\nAah man that\u0026rsquo;s a tough one honestly. I’ve found so many nice people on here and look up to most of them, for different things. Tokenbender has been a recent great buddy we hit off from the get go, so have joey and samosa haha who are relatively quite new. I like how the landscapes changed with new people yet there’s also the ones I’ve known since quite a while now; feels very homely. Telt, Vg, Tarun and the occasional ranting session with TDM, although it\u0026rsquo;s been a while now lol he’s been keeping busy.\nAlso ofc cringe and emacs haha! Cant forget them.\nHobbies?\nIdk man sports? That\u0026rsquo;s what I love and do the most right now. I used to read a lot too but its been a while. Profession?\nHopefully soon employed software engineer lol\nWhat is your favourite breakfast?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had quite a hearty breakfast lately lol. Yogurt bowl with granola and berries with a standard english breakfast, eggs bacon sausage beans and mushrooms. A dish you can never get enough of?\nA great lasagna is amazing. But if i am being honest i’ve survived on the sainsbury chicken tikka masala with rice meal\nAre you blocked by lex?\nLmao lemme check, I am ahah lfg.\nWhich programming language do you hate? (only for coders) **class hell in java oof** Who is your favourite anime waifu/ fav actress/actor? **Oh man there’s too many but touka is great.** What is the secret to your bangers? **I don't have any bangers. My homies are just too nice to not hype me up.** Favourite movie? (Any top 5) * **About Time** * **Shwashank redemption** * **4 weddings and a funeral** * **The breakfast club** * **Whiplash** **Just find me on letterboxd** any 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen? * **With Me - Sum 41** * **Girls Just want to have fun** * **Saviour - black veil brides** * **Summertime - mcr** * **Your love - outfield** any kinda sports you follow? **Religiously nah but whatever I am into or is going on at the time lol** Favourite pepe? **Cokaine and tdm have the best pepe game but i really like this one haha** The last meme that made you chuckle? **Imagining typec like this** Can you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities? **In terms of impact there might be 2 tbh. The first is how I was a lurker for the longest of time until telt messaged me out of the blue one day and idk why i started tweeting into the void, recently a guy messaged me to lmk how I had told to him to just be chill and talk to people and it had helped him a lot lol. Funny isn't it. Secondly, I think tokenbender’s been very helpful lately just helped a lot to get me back on track. Twitter might be great but its very easy to get absorbed into it.** A tweet you think is based? **Everyday is a blank slate that has its bangers.** An image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence?

I won’t tell you what it is you can find it out on your own.\nThere are similarities between Samosa ji and me, we both like to write.

A few weeks back I was out cycling in the evening and all of a sudden Lord Indra started a heavy downpour. I waited inside a nearby shop for some time but the rains didn't seem to be stopping anytime soon. So I said, \u0026quot;Screw it, I'll just cycle in the rain.\u0026quot; and loved it so much Can you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities? **It’s always interesting to get to know the real person behind the PFP. There’s only so much you can say in 280 characters (not counting the blue tick accounts here hehe). That, combined with the constant urge to put out something - something funny, something banger, something tongue-in-cheek - reveals only a part of a person to you. So it is always a delight when I get to know people beyond my usual twitter timeline. Everything from joining WhatsApp groups and discussing unhinged stuff there, going on Discord Channels and doing VCs for hours talking about what’s going on in each other’s lives, actually going forward to meet them in real life, do fun things and explore new places around together, these all are very memorable for me. I have found some really good folks here.** fin.\nWe thank basked_samosa for answering our questions, we wish him All the Best in his future endeavours, we’d like to see him opening his own Samosa chain some day in the future.

He is the co-founder for BBIT and a human being with a mesmerising chad voice.\nI interacted with Telt senpai in a GC and on a discord channel. Everyone at BBIT is a telt senpai voice stan.\nHonestly, I don’t know much about telt senpai. I have realised this while writing. I don’t know the reason for it. He seems to be friends with a lot of people on tpot. I have seen his tweet replies across all accounts on tpot. But the thing is I don’t have much to say.\nOh yes, he ran/runs a BBIT grant, the grant was to provide monetary assistance to projects. I also remember that he and a few BBIT folks sponsored a prize at some hackathon. He is an indie Philanthropist? I don’t know how to label this. He he he.\nQuestionnaire:\nWhen did you join? 2009\nHow did you come across tpot? I think it must have been a viral tweet and then I just looked at their follows.

Fav accs cause I found them first and loved the vibes: @DebadreeC, @cto_junior, @beeryaniboi and @dejavucoder. But there’s just way too many amazing anons that I’ve met irl or in various GCs.\nHobbies? books, placating my insecurities\nProfession? software enjoyoor\nWhat is your favourite breakfast? late lunch because intermittent fasting (this is how I lost a lot of weight the first time)\nA dish you can never get enough of? bhel Are you blocked by lex? nah I don’t follow him\nWhich programming language do you hate? (only for coders) I don’t hate on anything, why hold onto a hot coal especially those that don’t have side effects.\nWho is your favourite anime waifu/ fav actress/actor? Toss up between Mitsuha and Motoko Kusanagi (and maybe Dors Venabili)\nMitsuha Motoko Kusanagi What is the secret to your bangers? I feel like I got mostly lucky. It’s a combination of figuring out the current thing and making a joke about it but my bangers are not even close to being Bangers. It takes a bit of work to figure out what people talk about and play to the algorithm. Paraphrasing growing_daniel, “remember when I used to put in effort to write bangers”.\nFavourite movie? The Great Escape\nany 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen to?\n**Red Barchetta,** **Evergreen Cassette by Goldspot** **Ants Marching** **Chaudhary by Mame Khan** **Archie Marry Me** **Walking on The Moon.** any kinda sports you follow? Mostly Cricket and finals for most events.\nFavourite pepe? Smug pepe because it’s perfect what single advice would you give to your younger self when he/she is about to join twitter? and what\u0026rsquo;s the one thing you\u0026rsquo;d want them to absolutely not do here? **vibes are just one signal, (don't be an ass) be nice.** Can you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you?
