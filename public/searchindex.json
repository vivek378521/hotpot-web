  "content":"Been a long time folks, the ups and downs of running a 200 follower account got to us. One might think that running a 200 followers account might be an easy task but it isn\u0026rsquo;t. You need to think about traction, engagement and all that SEO bs. I never thought that a simple task could be so complex. With a lot of power, comes a lot of responsibility. I have realised that.\nWe are going back to the basics, featuring more people on the blog. Everything else is just noise. I love doing this and hopefully something good will come out of this.\nAnyway, today we have Darpan ji with us.\nHe is a pun-tastic person, okay, that\u0026rsquo;s all I know about him. I noticed Darpan ji when he was regularly posting puns on the hell-site (twitter). A lot of them are good. (No disrespecc)\nFame motivates him.\nI think I should know more about the person that I am featuring.\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join tpot?\nDon’t remember exactly since i dont know what qualifies as a TPOT. But can say 2023 maybe?\nOrigin of your username/handle? (iff)\nI don’t know it just happens that i suck at coming up with interesting usernames so i just decided to stick with the most basic one\nHow did you come across tpot?\nAll organically while doomscrolling twitter\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account?\nAny account that is funny and not overly negative. Anchal, beeryani, nitrojain, likitha, confused adult, cokane, pun parag, sadhvi, srijan mahajan, motonomad, nehal, shapegrifter and dramatickles\nHobbies?\nExploring new subcultures, design, architecture, geopolitics, writing (shitposting)\nProfession?\nI started my career in ad agencies and now I am the head of marketing at boxout.fm . My work involves promoting underground dance music and our weekly gigs, working with the DJs and producers to create content and promote their music, both organically and via paid media ( ads, PR and collaboration). I have also worked for the festivals like Boiler Room and Magnetic Fields.\nFavourite woman?\nWhat is your favourite breakfast?\nAnything with bread, butter, cheese, milkshake etc. OR maa ke hath ke aloo ke paranthe with homemade butter.\nA dish you can never get enough of?\nRajma Chawal, Thukpa, momo, mughlai chicken. Hard to choose one sorry.\nWhat Lays flavour do you like?\nIt’s Blue lays and Chile Limon on rotation these daysAre you blocked by lex?\nWhat is the secret to your bangers?\nThink i’m good with words and it comes naturally. But also I studied literature and started my career as a content writer. I came back on twitter just to sharpen my copywriting skills. That is why majority of my tweets are one liners.\nFavourite movie? (Any top 5)\nI don’t watch movies any more but long time back i used to love Fight Club, Dev D, Trainspotting and a few more maybe.\nany 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen?\nNo 5 songs but we at boxout.fm just released our best of 2023 playlists featuring the best releases from Indian Producers. These playlists are curated in collaboration with some of the best upcoming artists in their respective genres\n100% Indian Electronica (Curated by Kandy Kuri)\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/4sL8OVEUSRTJmtVfYt7kTR?si=24be85b642af4853 100% Indian Rap \u0026amp; Hip-Hop (Curated by Chaar Diwari)\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/1fOcibYsdQJrvl26CKgOzD?si=159967cede454a2f 100% Indian Alternative (Curated by Merak)\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/76MiJ054AyRsNwf66aU0Qa?si=cc3bcb65f97f461d any kinda sports you follow?\nlife on hard mode\nThe last meme that made you chuckle?\nAll bell IQ curve memes are my favourite\nAn image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence?\nWe are grateful to Darpan ji for taking out the time for us. This was way overdue, and we appreciate his patience. Bhery nice guy. May the force be with him.\n"},{

  "content":"We are the result of millions of years of evolution, and here we are, tweeting our lives away. Some days I wonder if everything is going to be done by robots; then, what will we humans do? I will become a writer; I know. I am not sure about what y\u0026rsquo;all will do.\nMaybe we all go back to farming. :')\nAnyway, today we have the elusive @beeryani with us.\nHis following-to-follower ratio is mind-boggling: for every person he follows, there are ~9.63 people following him. I wonder what the strategy behind this high conversion is.\nI met him on Twitter when I got into BBIT. I remember that he was grinding for his pivot to a dev role, and I was looking for a job. I believe he has left the dev grind, but I think he knows more than some SDEs. :P\nHe also referred me to the place he worked/works at. I am not an ungrateful person; I have thanked him for that!\nAnother reason that makes me relate to Beeryani is our mutual love for Kanpur. I think it is Stockholm syndrome, but whateva! :')\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join?\nMay 2022\nHow did you come across tpot?\nI met Sankalp ( https://twitter.com/dejavucoder ) and started interacting with Amul and a bunch of folks like TDM, Unironic and eventually met Telt in a hotel bar in Chennai, on a solo trip to Pondicherry\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account?\nMany such cases but\nhttps://twitter.com/ponnappa (Sidu Ponnappa)\nhttps://twitter.com/cto_junior (TDM)\nhttps://twitter.com/varunramg (Varunram Ganesh)\nhttps://twitter.com/cringelord2023 (cringelord)\nhttps://twitter.com/heyitstamanna (Tam) Hobbies?\nUsing Twitter/Ranting with strangers\nListening to esoteric music which won’t get me laid\nChecking my Stock Portfolio because money is my loyal friend Profession?\nCurrently, I am looking for a role, but last I checked, I was a consultant who wanted to move to Prawduct Manazement.\nWhat is your favourite breakfast?\nSabudana Khichdi, made by my mom, with tomatoes and peanuts\nA dish you can never get enough of?\nEgg Curry (that I cooked) and Tandoori Roti with pyaaz\nAre you blocked by lex?\nNope, not by him, but by my ex UwU\nWhich programming language do you hate? (only for coders)\nI have limited coding experience but C++ gave me a really hard time in college.\nWho is your favorite anime waifu?\nI don’t believe in AI wives, I want a hard working wife. Please send DMs, ladies.\nWhat is the secret to your bangers?\nI don’t have any bangers. I am a midwit Twitter user who’s just grifting atm.\nFavourite movie?

  "content":"How are you, my dear friends? I am doing alright. Today, I met Toad-sama while I was coming back home from the shop. I also met a lot of puppies. I was sick the past week; I think it\u0026rsquo;s the flu making rounds. When I am sick, I have this habit of giving up on life. So, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really focus on anything, and hotpot got delayed by a huge amount of time. I am sorry for making you all miss me.\nY\u0026rsquo;all did miss me right?\nAnyway, we have a star in our midst today, @barbie ji .\nI started noticing a glimmer of an exhausted Barbie on the TL when some of my oomfies started interacting with her posts. I thought, \u0026ldquo;Wow, another catfish account that will probably go bust in a month or so.\u0026rdquo; But then, my TL became Barbie, Barbie because of corporate propaganda by a company.\nAfter some time, we got to listen to Barbie sing and saw some photos, proving the account not to be a catfish. Turns out, Barbie is real; she lives in a tier 1 city and doesn\u0026rsquo;t speak much Hindi. She is a master procrastinator, likes to travel on her terms, and will feed you curd rice because it is the easiest to cook.\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join? April 2023\nOrigin of your username/handle? (iff)\nBarbie movie was the talk of the town and I am eternally exhausted so just randomly came up with the name. It\u0026rsquo;s also funny because some people who knew me from school times called me Barbie. How did you come across tpot? I didn’t. Tpot found me. I didn’t even know what it meant for a long time.\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account? Tutu!! Hobbies? Yes I do the cooking yes I do the cleaning\nWhat is your favourite breakfast? Idly Sambar\nA dish you can never get enough of? Broccoli Soup\nWhich programming language do you hate? (only for coders) Java Who is your favourite anime waifu/husbando fav actress/actor? Ken\nWhat is the secret to your bangers? Not my fault I am unintentionally funny\nFavourite movie? (Any top 5) Nah, I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything like that\nany 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen? I listen to a lot of classical music. Do not really have go-to songs. Favourite pepe?(optional)\nThe last meme that made you chuckle? I am that meme\nCan you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities? I like it every time I psyop people. Nothing has had any significant impact on me.\nA tweet you think is based? https://x.com/satintweety/status/1703364440559886365?s=46 An image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence?\nWhere do you get your coffee aesthetics from? I take a lot of pictures usually. I post anything I find pretty. Have you received formal training in singing? At what age did you start? I learnt a little bit of Carnatic music as a kid for a year. Then after 13 years, I started learning again in 2021.\nWhat do you like more cooking, eating or feeding? Eating, but I like to cook and feed as well. We thank barbie ji for doing this. We were aware of her reluctance, but we were successful in getting her featured. We wish her all the best for her future endeavours.\n"},{

  "content":"Happy New Year frens.\nWe had a good year overall. We featured cool people on our blog, went through some dry spells and lows, but we emerged strong. Y\u0026rsquo;all have been too kind to us, and we are eternally grateful for that. We will continue to give our best to the initiative; all we need is your support and blessings.\nToday we have with us @Aashutosh ji\nI met Aashutosh ji through the Nibble Mafia. He and Samosa ji together write for nibbles.dev , and they recently completed the 40th edition. I enjoy reading their newsletter. Y\u0026rsquo;all should subscribe too.\nSome of the best people I\u0026rsquo;ve met on TPOT have been nodes in a network graph—very cool people with shared interests and kindness. It\u0026rsquo;s always a pleasure to meet fellow writers. One vibes better with people of similar mentality.\nI also feel for Aashutosh ji because he will always be Roll No. 1 :')\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join tpot?\nJoined Twitter in 2015. I still don’t know when I became part of tpot, I feel I just got in touch with few folks on Twitter after we started writing Nibble and that was more or less gateway to it. Then I had to find the meaning of tpot.\nOrigin of your username/handle? (iff)\nLol, NA in my case, but Lord Shiva, wish I were anon though.\nHow did you come across tpot?\nOne fine day, dejavucoder \u0026amp; amuldotexe’s shit posts started coming in my feed, and later I talked to Sankalp about his blog. Found out a very good friend of mine is part of tpot. That was when I had questions like what’s tpot, what’s bbit, is there an urban dictionary?\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account?\nthe list keeps expanding and I know it’s not a good thing be worshipper. But the top ones are Yacine, TDM ji, TokenBender ji, FormerSnack san, cokane ji, dejavucoder. There are more I love my feed now a days.\nHobbies?\nreading on internet, writing/reviewing code. Once in a blue-moon hitting gym/badminton court, breaking my own losing streak record on chess.com , solving (try to) random Math olympiad problems and often testing my limits to live without hydrating.\nProfession?\nfull-time software tinkerer, currently on BFS to find the node to do DFS on.\nWhat is your favourite breakfast?\nGhee Podi Idli \u0026amp; Filter Coffee when in Bengaluru. Poha, Samosa \u0026amp; Chai when in North India\nA dish you can never get enough of?\nI would like to phrase my lack of taste palate as “I have my Rasanaa Indriya in control”.\nIf I had to answer it would be Kachori (we have best ones in my hometown), Makka Roti \u0026amp; Rajasthani Aalan saag.\nWhat Lays flavour do you like?\nit might hurt cokane ji, but it’s BLUE lays\nAre you blocked by lex?\nlol, no\nWhich programming language do you hate? (only for coders)\nomg I absolutely hate the syntax of Rust (prone to change hopefully)\nWho is your favourite anime waifu/ fav actress/actor?\nNanami Kento from JJK (from last 1 year)\nWhat is the secret to your bangers?\nI don’t think I have any, but it’s usually thot dump\nFavourite movie? (Any top 5)\nI have watched more Ghibli movies in last 2 years than one with humans in it. Here’s my list:\nThe Holiday (my brother made me watch this when I needed to)\nThe Wolf of Wall Street The Internship (watched this when I was in Kota prepping for JEE)\nThe Social Network (are you a nerd? yes sir)\nThe Interview (all in for mockumentaries)\nAny 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen?\nSome really mixed stuff, some are just music\nOptimistic Nihillism Yellow (yes part of Coldplay cult)\nViva La Vida (better when your code doesn’t work) [Bonus: Pal do pal ka shayar ]\nNeele Neele Ambar Par (and family of such songs)\nIntro by XXX\nany kinda sports you follow?\ncricket, enjoys watching democracy unfold \u0026amp; sometimes follows Chess\nFavourite pepe?\nI like this one as it accurately represents me reflecting back every friday after pushing bugs to prod.\nThe last meme that made you chuckle? (not from LastRU)\nCan you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities?\nI have not interacted with lot of folks, but whoever I connected with found them very helpful, smart and funny. It more or less impacts me in a way that I look forward to reading what they tweet and what they are exploring in tech/life.\nA tweet you think is based?\n-\u0026gt; from my LastRU cache\nAn image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence? We are thankful to Aashutosh ji for taking the time out for us. We wish him all the best for his future endeavors. May the force be with him, and may Nibbles continue publishing newsletters indefinitely.\n"},{

I feel that 2024 will be a better year overall. Why are all the sad songs so long? Why do humans have to infuse suffering into lyrics, crafting songs that bring sadness to the surface?

  "content":"Things have been a bit slow on my side. The stock market has been performing well for some days, but I see job losses around, so I am not sure about the state of the economy. I remember 10-12 years ago, I used to go to the vegetable vendor on a scooter. We used to buy vegetables worth 100-150 INR every week, and it would fill the bag. Today, when I go to the vendor and pay him 100 INR, only 1/3rd of the bag gets filled. Prices have risen.\nAnyway, this has been long pending, we are here with @astronikos today.\nI met Nikos Ji on bbit, and then he shared some of his hacking trauma, and we became friends. Now, I am his self-proclaimed best friend who doesn\u0026rsquo;t even know who he is in real life. But that\u0026rsquo;s fine. We\u0026rsquo;re tight.\nHe seems to have a penchant for suffering; I think he likes it. Maybe it gives him purpose? I\u0026rsquo;m not here to psychoanalyse him. He\u0026rsquo;s a good human being who has given me an open invitation to visit his home and play games on his PS5.\nAlso, he\u0026rsquo;s searching for someone ambitious to marry (or date?). So, if you\u0026rsquo;re an ambitious person ready to mingle, I (HotPot) endorse Astronikos. He has also been going to the gym! What say?\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join tpot?\nI joined twitter back in 2010 but only joined tpot with this alt around june 2023.\nOrigin of your username/handle? (iff)\nI’ve always been very introspective, all that thinking led me to a lot of ideas but also trapped me in a cynical headspace for a while, it took an effort to get out of it with a healthy and fresh perspective on life, i became more aware about that journey when i realized i\u0026rsquo;m a former pessimist (now leading towards optimistic nihilism).\nHow did you come across tpot?\nI came across tdm ji on my main account then through him I eventually found ftlsid around the time he was making a soap film simulator the updates on which hooked me in and made me want to join in the space.\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account?\nI like so many accounts here that it’s hard to pick any single one. I like how tdm ji pushes tpot to become better and more high agency, yacine’s cracked up poasting and development, tokenbender bhai being like a rare mentor figure i respect, cokane ji bringing balance being the funniest degen on here, prge bringing a vibe where everyone feels comfy and welcomed.\nHobbies?\nvideo games, gym(?), breaking linux and cuda installations\nProfession?\nData Scientist mostly doing CV (before tpot) but now mostly an imposter syndrome enjoyer (after tpot)\nWhat is your favourite breakfast?\nAnda bhurji and chai\nA dish you can never get enough of?\nDal Baati or Kachori (yes i’m from rajasthan why do you ask?)\nWhat Lays flavour do you like?\nWest Indies Hot n Sweet Chilli, (but Bingo Chilli Sprinkled is the only chips I need)\nAre you blocked by lex?\nYep, my dude didn\u0026rsquo;t like my critique of his VR pod. *It was ridiculous*\nWhich programming language do you hate? (only for coders)\nJava, its the only dogma i\u0026rsquo;ve held onto\nWho is your favourite anime waifu/ fav actress/actor?\nhim\nWhat is the secret to your bangers?\nBy periodically partaking in an ethereal detachment from reality.\nFavourite movie? (Any top 5)\nany 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen?\nLuv (sic) - Nujabes\nEpitaph - King Crimson\nThe Salmon Dance - The Chemical Brothers\nMemory Box - Peter Cat Recording Co.\nFujiyama - The Dave Brubeck Quartet\nany kinda sports you follow?\nNope, used to follow csgo esport scene but not anymore\nFavourite pepe?\nHe just hits home rn\nThe last meme that made you chuckle?\nCan you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities?\nRandomly deciding to go to sphinx ji’s meetup after being on tpot for like a month or so really changed how i looked at the space, it was an amazing experience meeting cool relatable nerds.\nA tweet you think is based?\nI cant think of one right now :’) but anything from Sam bhai would count.\nAn image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence?\nCapturing my overall essence is too hard, here’s at least one of em\nWe are eternally grateful to astronikos ji for taking out the time for this.

Rightly so. But things took a different turn, when people from tpot got actively involved.\nThere was a coup.\nOur Chief Editor pleaded to not fire the upper management.\nBut it was too late, the search for a new CEO had gone out.\nSoon people started throwing their hats into the race for choosing the next CEO and building a new board.\nThere were demands to dissolve the board\nBut our Growth VP intern protested!\nThen something magical happened.\nPower was restored and crisis was averted.\nThis teaches us a lesson, and kids what do you think it is?\nNever try to cross people who have power and money but lack a moral compass.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it, folks.

  "content":"So we are accelerating! I have decided that I will track all the people I have sent links to on Google Sheets and put in reminder dates, and persistently follow up with them until they have filled out the questionnaire—no sitting passively. Yes, we started as a fun initiative, but now we will force people to have fun. *angy*\nAnyway, let\u0026rsquo;s welcome today\u0026rsquo;s guest, hotpot\u0026rsquo;s Growth VP intern, Jazzy I met Jazzy on LinkedIn. I think he was the one who suggested logging onto Twitter, and now we\u0026rsquo;re here—canon event! You folks must have seen that meme, right? It goes like this:\nIf my tweet has 100 likes, then Jazzy is one of them.\nIf my tweet has 1 like, then Jazzy is the one who liked it.\nIf my tweet has no likes, then Jazzy might be busy, and he will like it when he comes back online.\nJazzy also played a significant role in pushing my entry into BBIT. I owe a lot of my Twitter journey to him. I frequently notice Jazzy lurking in the BBIT group chat, although he posts often. I believe he views Twitter as his online journal.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s one of the most supportive people I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered on Twitter.\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join?\nI have been on twitter since 2017. I accidentally opened it due to some reason I can\u0026rsquo;t recall in 2021 again. I followed some tech accounts and active since then.\nHow did you come across tpot?\nIt would be when I followed some of the folks here like sankalp, unironic, debadree etc. More interaction, becoming part of bbit gc and I got to know more and more about tpot. Since then, came a long way and now I know so many cool amazing people here and still meeting more.\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account? @visakanv\nHobbies?\nNo hobbies. But on separate sidenote, I consider watching movies, listening songs as something I like to do in free time 🤪\nProfession?\nThe IT Guy fixing page of your colour \u0026amp; sending you annoying emails *I once built a cron that used to periodically spam people with whatsapp messages :P*\nWhat is your favourite breakfast?\nPoha (with sev important)\nA dish you can never get enough of?\nAaloo ka Parantha\nAre you blocked by lex?\nNo 😭😭 But let me tell you I am blocked by taleb 🥹\nWhich programming language do you hate? (only for coders)\nI don\u0026rsquo;t hate any programming language but you know, java/golang can be purged out. What do you mean I am python guy ?\nWho is your favourite anime waifu?\nMayuri from Steins Gate\nWhat is the secret to your bangers?\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t posted any bangers 😭😭\nIncel?\nHave to investigate. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I am.\nFavourite movie? (Any top 5)\nThe Terminal\nFast and Furious 1\nSing Street\nAnand\nRocky Balboa\nany 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen?\nMonster by YOASOBI\nRunaway by Aurora\nTabun By YOASOBI\nNaina Da Kya Kasoor\nMasakali\nany kinda sports you follow?\nNo sports in this arena.\nFavourite pepe?\nThe last meme that made you chuckle?\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t saved it\nSaw this today. It reminded me of my GCP bill 😂\nAn image from your camera roll that captures your overall essence?\nWe are eternally grateful to Jazzy ji for everything he has done for us.

You know, cats and wholesomeness—seems like an odd pairing. :P\nWe adore cats. Our initial interaction with Puru was through Miaow\u0026rsquo;s tweets, observing Puru lurking around on tpot.

  "content":"I have realised that when I sleep on time and enjoy undisturbed sleep, I wake up in a better mood. Therefore, I have decided not to take naps during the day.\nPlease welcome our today’s guest, Likitha ji .\nI had seen her on my timeline many times, so after the hotpot blog gained some traction, I asked her if she’d be interested in being featured. Hers is the account with the highest number of followers that we have featured so far! :P\nNo, I\u0026rsquo;m not doing this for attention. I already received validation from my mom when I helped with the Diwali cleaning. The last I heard, Likitha ji was reading romance novels. I believe her standards and expectations of love may have increased. She has travelled around the whole SEA.\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join?\nProbably 10 years ago, but became active only during the pandemic. Origin of your username/handle? (iff)\nLol needed a pseudonym when I got suspended from school to get on social media. Pseudonym Bosch was the name of a popular author - ripped it off him to create Pseudonym Elektra. How did you come across tpot?\nJust started liking random Anon Acc tweets I suppose. But probably had to be Shri Hacker’s tweets I ever saw first.\nHobbies?\nYknow it. Pumping iron and reading historical romance while dissing the world for not playing enough Catan. Profession?\nProduct Designer What is your favourite breakfast?\nDosa and Onion Chutney A dish you can never get enough of?\nAndhra Chicken Biryani\nWho is your favourite anime waifu/husbando/ fav actress/actor? Henry Cavill - been a while since I have been obsessed with anyone tbh.\nWhat is the secret to your bangers? It is literally a shot in the dark - the world chooses what it wants to see and I am a mere pawn.\nFavourite movie? (Any top 5)\n- Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (1 and 2)\n- Final Destination 3\n- DJ Tillu\n- Me before you\n- A millionaire’s first love\nany 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen?\n- Smoke by Tender\n- Penny Sweets by Winter Aid\n- What Once Was by Her’s\n- Jungle by Tash Sultana\n- Skinny by Kaleo\nany kinda sports you follow?\nNah\nThe last meme that made you chuckle?\nCan you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities? Two boys with the same name made it a point to meet me when I asked them to buy me coffee for kicks and have been sanity pillars since. *I know who these two boys are :P*\nA tweet you think is based?\nAn image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence? What is the story behind your golden wrist watch? Have seen it in images. I like flashy accessories and Gold goes well with all outfits. Have seen your before/after pics, what made you take the decision to take up working out? I wanted more from life. I wanted to be accepted and loved (sadly, being unattractive makes it hard). I was tired of being the “fat and funny” chick. Add in familial disease of BP and Diabetes, I knew health would be a short lived thing for me. So, I decided I had to take responsibility and make changes\nWhy don’t you have a cover image? I don’t know why, honestly.\nFavourite coffee? (what do you prefer when you go to the coffee shop?) Lately, I have been obsessing over Vietnamese Iced Coffee. But otherwise, I’ll get a Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew or Cold Brew.\nWhat tweet from your Twitter profile would you choose to introduce someone to your online persona, and why? I am nothing and everything you see on my socials._\nWe are eternally grateful to Likitha ji for making an appearance on our blog. We wish her all the best for all her future endeavours. We believe she can conquer the world. May the force be with her.\n"},{

  "content":"I have no fun anecdotes to share today about my life. It has been pretty bland since a few days. The doggo my family feeds and takes care of has started to follow me everywhere. Anyway.\nThis is the Diwali Edition 🪔 blog, featuring Niharika ji . I am very happy that she agreed to do this. She once called this initiative wholesome, and that is how this got initiated. We don’t know much about Niharika ji; previously, I talked to only people I had interacted with. But I remember when threads came out, a few tpot people and I shifted to threads, and I discovered Niharika ji’s account there. I had seen her on my Twitter timeline before, but she wasn\u0026rsquo;t that integrated with the circle I hang out with. But it became a passing thought because she was on a sabbatical from Twitter.\nI think she hangs out with the sophisticated circle of tpot; our circles intersected with 1-2 people in common, but now I don’t see those 1-2 people around anymore, so now both the circles are different. When I say sophisticated, I mean the people aren’t that unhinged.\nNo, I am not treading the line of labeling people elitist. Why do your minds go to places where they shouldn’t go?\nAs I said, I don’t know much about her, and the reason I believe is very apt. One shouldn’t reveal themselves to total internet strangers, and that is a good policy to follow.\nI think she likes to click photos, but photography isn’t her profession (I guess).\nOh, also: Happy Deepawali, frens!\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join?\nLast year in May with little to no intention of interacting with anyone. I joined because I met a person on a trip who was building a network on twitter and I thought that was interesting, because the side of twitter I was exposed to was only political dramas and senseless gossip. I lurked around for a while, until I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to anymore. It was life-changing in certain ways. I am not even exaggerating.\nOrigin of your username/handle? (iff)\nIt’s just my name, except not exactly. I use a fake last name on all socials so no coworker can find me. That’s as much anon as I can be. Some on tpot know I am quick to share details about myself, so I keep one element of surprise for the future.\nHow did you come across tpot?\nThe tpot I knew is different from the bbit tpot. One of the first anons I spoke with was @catdaddyissues. It truly was a canon event. I found many more through @rahul__and. Another significant find was @dejavucoder whose first interaction with me was “aap boomer ho kya?”. This boomer found many more on tpot thanks to dejavu.\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account?\n@dejavucoder, @cokanestudio\nWhat is your favorite breakfast?\nAnything that is hot and spicy. Sweet and cold breakfasts make no sense to me. Need a hit of spice to wake me up. And a big glass of filter coffee. Scrambled eggs with tabasco, lentil khichdi, rice bath (it is a karnataka thing - hot rice item with ghee poured over it, along with a coconut chutney, ah lord!). Idly-chutney, if I am eating at a hotel. Certain darshinis have watery chutney that they pour over the idlies, like sambhar, and boy that makes me so happy!\nA dish you can never get enough of?\nPesto Pasta with broccoli and sun dried tomatoes. Evergreen favorite. And lately, Shin Ramyun, the instant one. I have been experimenting with all kinds of toppings. It is insanely fun and delicious.\nWhat Lays flavour do you like?\nChile Limon\nWho is your favourite anime waifu/ fav actress/actor?\nNo name comes off the top of my head, so none.\nWhat is the secret to your bangers?\nI don’t think I have any bangers. You should’ve seen the other person (my anon)\nFavourite movie? (Any top 5) - Sigh! I wish I had an answer.\nAny 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen to?\nCold Little Heart - Michael Kiwanuka\nInside of Love - Nada Surf\nKya Dekhu - Osho Jain\nSaturn - Sleeping At Last\nUnforgettable - Nat King Cole\nAny kinda sports you follow? On and off I follow tennis, that’s it.\nFavourite pepe? This. So fucking stupid, what is this, I love it so much! Also, a majority of tdm and cokane’s stash.\nThe last meme that made you chuckle? I have more saved comics than memes, so this one: Can you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities? The amount of support I have received here is unmatched by anything I have ever experienced in my life. Last year my family went through a tough time, and tpot stood for me through it all. A beautiful bunch of strangers-turned-friends holding me through words, through virtual hugs, and in all ways they could think of. It felt surreal to receive so much love. Never once did I feel alone in that fight; the beauty of this soulful community.\nA tweet you think is based? Nothing. There has been a lot of noise on the tl lately. People love to provoke, don’t they?\nAn image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence? These are what I mark as the essence of my existence, hence mine too.\nWe are eternally grateful to Niharika ji for agreeing to do this. We would like to gift her some hotpot goodies but unfortunately we have none. We wish her all the best for her future endeavours and may she succeed in whatever she decides to do in her life.\nCheers.\n"},{

  "content":"My stress buster was to roam around the city in vice city in a car and follow traffic rules whilst doing that. Do people do that? But sometimes I also sat in a tank and destroyed the city.\nAnyway, our guest for today is, @vishwanath !\nI had seen Vishwanath Ji frequently on my timeline, but I only interacted with him when he joined a mutual group chat. He is a well-mannered and spiritually inclined individual. Vishwanath owns a gaming PC and enjoys playing a variety of games. Although he claims to be just an average gamer, it\u0026rsquo;s apparent that he plays games purely for fun. He even used a trainer to successfully complete the Vice City RC Helicopter mission.\nHis top three favourite games are GTA V, Days Gone, and Cyberpunk 2077.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t witnessed him becoming unhinged over silly things on Twitter, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible that he has an alternate account where he expresses a different side of himself. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that he frequently posts about football and Formula 1. He resides in Bangalore, which can be easily determined by reviewing his tweets.\nHe has an alt on twitter where he is unhinged. :’)\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join?\nTwitter? 2016\nOrigin of your username/handle?

I don’t worship any account. :P Hobbies?\nAlerting tpot about any e-lafdas, playing guitar, discovering niche music, diving deep into internals of coding tools I use, being terminally online, space \u0026amp;black holes, meditating, solo traveling, working out.\nProfession?\nPixel-perfect Wage-coolie (read as frontend engineer)\nWhat is your favourite breakfast?\nToasted bread + cheese\nA dish you can never get enough of?\nPizza\nAre you blocked by lex?\nNope. :(\nWhich programming language do you hate?

  "content":"Yesterday, I was pondering how we arrived at this point in life. Countless events became entangled, giving birth to new occurrences. I also realized that it\u0026rsquo;s all just a complex web of interactions involving multiple events triggered by different individuals. So, we find ourselves here due to the actions of various people, including my own, and everything has simply accumulated.\nAnyway, today we bring to you, Dr. @Brian ji! (he is real doctor not phd one :P)\nI met Brian Ji in a mutual Twitter group chat, and as always, I started asking silly questions. Not only was he nice enough to answer them all, but he also DMed me, saying that I can ask him questions whenever I want. Even my teachers haven\u0026rsquo;t entertained the idea of their students asking silly questions.\nHe lives in Las Vegas. Also, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t consume any seed oils. I was blown away when I learned about it.\nI normally meet a lot of cool anonymous users on Twitter, but the first genuinely cool person with a profile picture of himself. He used to collect basketball cards when he was a kid. Did I mention that he is a doctor? The Indian shaadi market will go nuts for him.\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join?\nMy profile says I joined March 2015, but I probably didn’t start really using Twitter until summer/fall 2016.\nOrigin of your username/handle? (iff)\nSeems pretty self-evident\nHow did you come across tpot?\nNot sure to be honest, don’t think I intentionally became a part of it. Was just interacting with various accounts and becoming mutuals with them and then at some point we became tpot.\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account?\nThat honor goes to my brother from another mother @varunramg. Also @pajeetbateman though sadly he is no longer with us.\nHobbies?\nHiking, reading, weightlifting, cooking, linguistics. Recently started taking dance classes which has been fun. *Based*\nProfession?\nPhysician, specifically neurologist. Though I do telemedicine now that doesn’t involve seeing patients (if you listen to the podcast episode I have pinned on my profile I go into more details regarding exactly what I do).\nWhat is your favourite breakfast?\nMy standard breakfast is usually just eggs and coffee. In terms of favorites however I do love Scandinavian and Japanese breakfasts (there’s something about having fish in the morning that hits the spot).\nA dish you can never get enough of?\nSushi and yakiniku\nAre you blocked by lex?\nLast I checked, no. Somebody actually put me on a list called “Not yet blocked by Lex”.\nWho is your favourite anime waifu/ fav actress/actor?\n**Robert Downey Jr.** What is the secret to your bangers? **I just post and let the universe do with it what it will.** Favourite movie? (Any top 5) * **The Matrix** * **Lost in Translation** * **As Good As It Gets** * **John Wick 4** * **Parallels** any 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen? * **1er Gaou by Magic System** * **Wakarimasen by MIYACHI** * **Habibi by Ricky Rich \u0026amp; ARAM Mafia** * **Aitvaar by Jaz Dhami** * **SLR by Lupe Fiasco** any kinda sports you follow? **Not much of a sports guy** The last meme that made you chuckle? **Can’t recall exactly, but likely was something posted by @SeedOilDsrspctr** An image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence? We are eternally grateful to Brian ji for giving us the time and answering all the questions. We wish him all the best for all his future endeavours. Hope he gets to tour India and gets married, soon.\nBrian ji will accompany you in Las Vegas if you subscribe\n"},{

I would read more, write sci-fi novels and interview people.\nAnyway, let’s get to our guest for today, @DeepknowledgeU , or more famously known as Govind.\nHe is everywhere, but he is nowhere. He likes semi-conductors and protein. I haven’t interacted much on a personal level with him, only had conversations around infra in India, politics, defence manufacturing. I have seen him involved in muscle maxxing conversations, but I have no interest in gyming so I have nothing to contribute to those discussions.\nMy thoughts are enclosed in *my_inner_monologue*.\nQuestionnaire:\nWhen did you join?\nEnd of high school, wasn’t active until 2016-17, then deleted my account, then created it anew, like a Phoenix out of the ashes.\nHow did you come across tpot?\nI got an honorary invite into the GC by one of the chaddest members of the group (has a jaw that looks like solid granite that can withstand a 1000 invasions)\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account?\nClosest I come to worshiping is probably John Carmack, but no I don’t worship, just follow: ID_AA_Carmack\nSome serious tech poasting account I love : eatonphil, cto_junior (the ever amazing TDM) , and Token Bender (4evaBehindSOTA) Hobbies?\nBouldering / bicycling / fixing my bike / reading (planning to pick up some physical tinkering hobby next year)\nProfession? Software Engineer\nWhat is your favourite breakfast? Black Coffee and Cigarettes (quit smoking, so just black coffee now ) Are you blocked by lex? Never followed him in the first place and no, not blocked\nWhich programming language do you hate? (only for coders)\nRuby. There are language, shit languages, horrible languages and then there is Ruby, more specifically Ruby on Rails (or should I say Walking on Nails)\nWho is your favourite anime waifu?\nWhat is the secret to your bangers? Rhyming, Vibing and Timing\nIncel? Thankfully no longer. Got myself Incel Therapy (wink wink :P)\nFavourite movie? (Any top 5) : Predator, The Terminator , True Lies, Top Gun, Dark Knight\nany 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen?\n**Tool - Parabol / Parabola** **Daft Punk - Derezzed** **Kyuss - (the entire Blues for the Red Sun album, its’ just glorious)** **Metallica - Fade to Black** **Buckethead - Siege Engine** any kinda sports you follow? **Football** _\\*never saw him talk about football though maybe IRL he enjoys watching football\\*_ Favourite pepe?

  "content":"I got up early today, because a mouse was making a ruckus and throwing things which were kept above the wardrobe. So I and my mother got up at 4:00 AM, and started chasing the mouse with broom and mop. After some time of brainstorming and blocking the mouse’s tracks, we were successful in my forcing the mouse to the go back the way he came from, that it, to the balcony.\nAnyway, let me introduce today’s guest, @jbasedos !\nI met jeff ji on bbit, one day he appeared, we did not know who he was. But his ideas and ideologies were a fit for bbit. Recently, we have had a small conversation on twitter on how Maggi Atta Noodles are goated. He has a PS5, he has a car, he works in tech, and I think one day he will come back to India, start his own company and employ me as the VP.\nOur views on MCU also are synonymous, it has gone downhill. After End Game, it was the End of MCU. His favourite MCU character is Spider-man and I think MCU’s salvation is Spider-man. Everything else is gone. Turned to dust.\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join?\nAround 2018, I had a personal account before that but I purged it and went anon.\nOrigin of your username/handle?

(only for coders)\n**Java, no further comment** Who is your favourite anime waifu/ fav actress/actor? **Favorite actor is Christian Bale, I don’t watch anime anymore so haven’t kept up with the waifu scene.** \\*After asking him to give a female name, he turned towards JL\\* What is the secret to your bangers? **I don’t think I have any bangers lmao** Favourite movie? (Any top 5) **I’ll do something different and mention my favorite movies that aren’t in the top 50 imdb since those are too cliche:** * **Wall E** * **Taare Zameen Par** * **Tonari no Totoro** * **Dune** * **Fury** any 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen? * **Desi Kalakaar - Yo Yo Honey Singh** * **Stay High - Juice WRLD** * **3005 - Childish Gambino** * **Fast Lane - Eminem** * **Yacht (K) - Jay Park** any kinda sports you follow? **I like motorsports, I follow both Formula-1 and MotoGP, I try to keep up with GT-Racing but its not as popular** The last meme that made you chuckle? Can you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities? **I feel that people in bbit (tpot) are really open and supportive of each other, I’ve had conversations where i leave feeling motivated and wanting to build. This kind of motivational environment is hard to find.** A tweet you think is based? An image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence?

  "content":"All of you who are wondering what JSK stands for, it is, Jai Shri Krishna. I am not going to explain the origin.\nI started interacting with Shri Hacker ji when he gave me advice on how to build my resume, I think he asked me to remove my highschool grade from the resume. Yes, I had high school grades in my resume. Since then I have seen him on the tl a lot more. Some of y’all must have had Shri ji’s Mom’s food.

I want to avoid dying from diabetes :P\nAnyway, let’s welcome today’s guest, @Sam Laki I met Sam on the BBIT gc, he reacts to every message, that is one of the most wholesome things about the lad. He acknowledges, and might laugh at silly jokes too. Given his strength, I find it a bit confusing on how is such a humble lad. I think if you ask him he will readily help you move houses.\nHe knows a lot of foreign people, I am not sure how. I haven’t asked him. He interacts with a lot of research posts and “study” posts. He doesn’t get involved in politics and e-lafdas. If I had even a quarter of his strength I would straight up become a bully :P\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join?

Will songs trigger feeling when we build a conscious machine?\nAnyway, let’s welcome our guest for today, Param .\nI met Param ji on tpot, haven’t interacted much with him, but I feel the whole tpot knows that he is on a sabbatical. He was doing something related to sicp and QR code menus, but now it has been quite some time since I got an update. I played a game he made on his website adventures.param.codes . I think he is enjoying his sabbatical. You get to try a lot of things.\nPS - I am not encouraging you to go on a sabbatical. This is not an advice and should anything go wrong you have no right to sue us.\nYou can understand by his twitter handle that he likes computer. Computers are complex things, humans are complex-er. Maybe some day, Computers will build humans.\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join?\nTwitter? 2011, just when i came across the wider internet.\ntpot? i guess, you could say last year, although was more lurking\nHow did you come across tpot?\nroon\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account?\nworship is a strong word but i like yacine, tdm, tokenbender, roon\nHobbies?\nchess, thinking of project ideas but not completing them\nProfession?\nsoftware engineer, currently on sabbatical\nWhat is your favourite breakfast?\nwake up too late to eat breakfast\nA dish you can never get enough of?\nchilli chicken\nAre you blocked by lex?\nnope 😎\nWhich programming language do you hate?

  "content":"Yesterday wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a good day, but today is better, and life seems worth living.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not really sure if labelling a young lad as a \u0026rsquo;tpot fboi\u0026rsquo; will affect his image, but then again, all of this is for fun.\nLet me introduce our guest for today, @prge !\nInnit?\nJust had to do that, sorry.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve interacted with him on Discord voice chat and heard him hosting spaces. He\u0026rsquo;s a nice lad. I recently broke his trust by spreading disinformation about Bollywood. From what I\u0026rsquo;ve gathered talking to him, he\u0026rsquo;s a hardworking person.\nHis mission is to \u0026lsquo;colonize\u0026rsquo; the UK.\nWhen I interacted with him, it felt like we were already friends. On the contrary, now that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about it, I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about him. I saw a video of him dancing, if that counts as getting to know each other.\nHe has traveled all over India for holidays and vacations, and he enjoys rock climbing. He\u0026rsquo;s also reading \u0026lsquo;Jujutsu Kaisen\u0026rsquo;, and that is all I could figure out from his profile on X.\nQuestionnaire\nWhen did you join?\nI think around feb 21 i got logged out of my og account and so decided to make this anon one.\nOrigin of your username/handle? (iff)\nThe kid in me always was fascinated by cool sounding names so I just made something up. Whats funny is I managed to not forget it haha\nHow did you come across tpot?\nNot really sure tbh, but i’ve followed telt and cokane since a long while, unironic too. Oh also I think vg followed me very very early on and then I think that was enough for me to start following anons haha\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account?\nAah man that\u0026rsquo;s a tough one honestly. I’ve found so many nice people on here and look up to most of them, for different things. Tokenbender has been a recent great buddy we hit off from the get go, so have joey and samosa haha who are relatively quite new. I like how the landscapes changed with new people yet there’s also the ones I’ve known since quite a while now; feels very homely. Telt, Vg, Tarun and the occasional ranting session with TDM, although it\u0026rsquo;s been a while now lol he’s been keeping busy.\nAlso ofc cringe and emacs haha! Cant forget them.\nHobbies?\nIdk man sports? That\u0026rsquo;s what I love and do the most right now. I used to read a lot too but its been a while. Profession?\nHopefully soon employed software engineer lol\nWhat is your favourite breakfast?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had quite a hearty breakfast lately lol. Yogurt bowl with granola and berries with a standard english breakfast, eggs bacon sausage beans and mushrooms. A dish you can never get enough of?\nA great lasagna is amazing. But if i am being honest i’ve survived on the sainsbury chicken tikka masala with rice meal\nAre you blocked by lex?\nLmao lemme check, I am ahah lfg.\nWhich programming language do you hate? (only for coders) **class hell in java oof** Who is your favourite anime waifu/ fav actress/actor? **Oh man there’s too many but touka is great.** What is the secret to your bangers? **I don't have any bangers. My homies are just too nice to not hype me up.** Favourite movie? (Any top 5) * **About Time** * **Shwashank redemption** * **4 weddings and a funeral** * **The breakfast club** * **Whiplash** **Just find me on letterboxd** any 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen? * **With Me - Sum 41** * **Girls Just want to have fun** * **Saviour - black veil brides** * **Summertime - mcr** * **Your love - outfield** any kinda sports you follow? **Religiously nah but whatever I am into or is going on at the time lol** Favourite pepe? **Cokaine and tdm have the best pepe game but i really like this one haha** The last meme that made you chuckle? **Imagining typec like this** Can you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities? **In terms of impact there might be 2 tbh. The first is how I was a lurker for the longest of time until telt messaged me out of the blue one day and idk why i started tweeting into the void, recently a guy messaged me to lmk how I had told to him to just be chill and talk to people and it had helped him a lot lol. Funny isn't it. Secondly, I think tokenbender’s been very helpful lately just helped a lot to get me back on track. Twitter might be great but its very easy to get absorbed into it.** A tweet you think is based? **Everyday is a blank slate that has its bangers.** An image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence? We are eternally grateful to @prge for taking out time and answering our questions. We wish him all the best for all his future endeavours and hope he succeeds in life. May the force be with him.\nIf you subscribe then prge will invite you to the Buckingham Palace where you will have tea with the King.\n"},{

  "content":"Did I tell you about the huge frog? Oh, yes, I did. I have been feeling a little off, maybe it is because of the sudden change in the weather, maybe viral is approaching. I cannot pin the reason, maybe I’m still fuzzy because of the anti-allergic I took yesterday night because my nose was stuffy. Anyway, let’s move on!\nToday’s guest is none other than, Ranveer !\nSo yes Ranveer, I met Ranveer on, well, twitter. He was tweeting about freelancing and stuff, so I DM-ed him. We talked about how to set up your accounts on fiverr/upwork, get freelance work, make your profile awesome and earn moolah.\nRanveer is a CPA, that much is written on his profile, duh. Lively fellow, interested in women, I think he is inclined towards Lahori Kudis. How do I know this?

  "content":"Before I get to the guest for today, let me tell you about something I saw today, I saw a big frog today, like really big. Can you believe it? Okay, stop I can sense that y’all don’t care, anyway lets move on!\nOur guest for today is a snacc, presenting basked_samosa !\nI met Samosa ji on, yes, twitter. He co-writes a newsletter: nibbles.dev . It is the only newsletter than I read on a regular basis. Samosa ji is also interested in origin of words. My latest surprise was the origin of the word `kukurmutta` (कुकुरमुत्ता) - mushroom. I won’t tell you what it is you can find it out on your own.\nThere are similarities between Samosa ji and me, we both like to write. I feel he is a better writer and I’d learn from him.\nHe is a wholesome human and I am glad that I got introduced to him. We both are cokanestudio stans. I am not sure if Samosa ji can cook a Samosa IRL, but I hope that he can.\nMy thoughts are encapsulated in **.\nBasic Questionnaire:\nWhen did you join?\n2018 but started being active from Q2 2023.\nHow did you come across tpot?\ni used to follow @dejavucoder on twitter and substack. if you don’t know him (shame on you if you don’t), he’s the apple of tpot’s eyes and through him, i got to know other fellow tpotians.\nWhich account do you worship here/ fav account?\noh it’s you mr. vivek , who else? i also like random accounts that post pretty cloud pics. *this is just flattery, you were appreciating dejavucoder above*\nHobbies?\nreading books, sketching, playing badminton, cycling, finding stories behind word origins.\nProfession? full slap stack developer.\nWhat is your favourite breakfast? boiled/raw sprouts.\nA dish you can never get enough of? laccha paratha and matar paneer with thandi thandi rice kheer (prepared by my mataji).\nAre you blocked by lex? no. i love lex and all the humans on this planet. why would he block me?\nWhich programming language do you hate? (only for coders)\nbaji (jk, just wanted to appreciate joey’s work here). i don’t know enough yet to form an opinion to hate a language (it’s css).\nWho is your favourite anime waifu?\n**faye valentine from kauboi bibappu.** _\\*ahh bebop\\*_ What is the secret to your bangers? **पोथी पढ़ी पढ़ी जाग मुआ बैंगर भाया ना कोय, ढाई आखर ‘just be yourself’ का, पढ़े सो बैंगर होय।** Incel? wish i wasn’t 🙁 *codermatrimony.com*\nFavourite movie?

Rafi** any kinda sports you follow? none\nFavourite pepe?\nThe last meme that made you chuckle? An image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence? I love this one! A few weeks back I was out cycling in the evening and all of a sudden Lord Indra started a heavy downpour. I waited inside a nearby shop for some time but the rains didn't seem to be stopping anytime soon. So I said, \u0026quot;Screw it, I'll just cycle in the rain.\u0026quot; and loved it so much Can you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities? **It’s always interesting to get to know the real person behind the PFP. There’s only so much you can say in 280 characters (not counting the blue tick accounts here hehe). That, combined with the constant urge to put out something - something funny, something banger, something tongue-in-cheek - reveals only a part of a person to you. So it is always a delight when I get to know people beyond my usual twitter timeline. Everything from joining WhatsApp groups and discussing unhinged stuff there, going on Discord Channels and doing VCs for hours talking about what’s going on in each other’s lives, actually going forward to meet them in real life, do fun things and explore new places around together, these all are very memorable for me. I have found some really good folks here.** fin.\nWe thank basked_samosa for answering our questions, we wish him All the Best in his future endeavours, we’d like to see him opening his own Samosa chain some day in the future. May the force be with him.\nThanks for reading, for a free samosa, please subscribe.\n"},{

  "content":"I think a polarised world will work in the benefit of human society because people will see how ridiculous the extreme opinions are and then people will start floating over the centre. I am just putting out this idea, I don’t know if it makes sense.\nAnyway, today I bring Telt senpai to all y’all. He is the co-founder for BBIT and a human being with a mesmerising chad voice.\nI interacted with Telt senpai in a GC and on a discord channel. Everyone at BBIT is a telt senpai voice stan.\nHonestly, I don’t know much about telt senpai. I have realised this while writing. I don’t know the reason for it. He seems to be friends with a lot of people on tpot. I have seen his tweet replies across all accounts on tpot. But the thing is I don’t have much to say.\nOh yes, he ran/runs a BBIT grant, the grant was to provide monetary assistance to projects. I also remember that he and a few BBIT folks sponsored a prize at some hackathon. He is an indie Philanthropist? I don’t know how to label this. He he he.\nQuestionnaire:\nWhen did you join? 2009\nHow did you come across tpot? I think it must have been a viral tweet and then I just looked at their follows. Might have been @allgarbled or @growing_daniel Which account do you worship here/ fav account? Fav accs cause I found them first and loved the vibes: @DebadreeC, @cto_junior, @beeryaniboi and @dejavucoder. But there’s just way too many amazing anons that I’ve met irl or in various GCs.\nHobbies? books, placating my insecurities\nProfession? software enjoyoor\nWhat is your favourite breakfast? late lunch because intermittent fasting (this is how I lost a lot of weight the first time)\nA dish you can never get enough of? bhel Are you blocked by lex? nah I don’t follow him\nWhich programming language do you hate? (only for coders) I don’t hate on anything, why hold onto a hot coal especially those that don’t have side effects.\nWho is your favourite anime waifu/ fav actress/actor? Toss up between Mitsuha and Motoko Kusanagi (and maybe Dors Venabili)\nMitsuha Motoko Kusanagi What is the secret to your bangers? I feel like I got mostly lucky. It’s a combination of figuring out the current thing and making a joke about it but my bangers are not even close to being Bangers. It takes a bit of work to figure out what people talk about and play to the algorithm. Paraphrasing growing_daniel, “remember when I used to put in effort to write bangers”.\nFavourite movie? The Great Escape\nany 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen to?\n**Red Barchetta,** **Evergreen Cassette by Goldspot** **Ants Marching** **Chaudhary by Mame Khan** **Archie Marry Me** **Walking on The Moon.** any kinda sports you follow? Mostly Cricket and finals for most events.\nFavourite pepe? Smug pepe because it’s perfect what single advice would you give to your younger self when he/she is about to join twitter? and what\u0026rsquo;s the one thing you\u0026rsquo;d want them to absolutely not do here? **vibes are just one signal, (don't be an ass) be nice.** Can you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you? I met an anon and realised there\u0026rsquo;s a way to jump the online-offline gap and, the vibes follow.\nCan you share an image that captures your essence as a human?\nfin.\nWe are eternally grateful to Telt senpai for taking out the time and answering our questions. We wish him all the best for all his future endeavours, may he become a Pokemon trainer, get a Raichu and win the Pokemon Battle Tournament.\nTelt Senpai will send a personalised voice recording to everyone who subscribes.\n"},{

  "content":"Today we are going to talk about a human who plays with LLMs (Large Language Models), TokenBender (e/xperiments) .\nYes, we are going to talk `about him` and not `to him`.\nYes, I have confirmed his pronoun preference.\nSo bender ji is my senpai, no not in that kind of way you morons! He is someone whom I have conversed with on discord. We talked about LLMs and everything around it.\nBender senpai created his account in college but wasn’t active until the start of this year. He found many like minded people here and then ended up interacting with schizos. I have never seen him interact with political posts or bait posts, I also believe it is the reason that he has maintained his sanity. he-he-he\nSo text inside *my inner monologue* is my inner monologue.\nBasic Questionnaire\nWhich account do you worship here? I don\u0026rsquo;t worship anyone specifically but I admire folks like Karpathy/Gerganov. At the same time, I don\u0026rsquo;t trust everything they say as well\nHobbies? reading novels, swimming, strategy games of any kind - you can find him in his society’s swimming pool whenever he feels - *okay he said twice a week*\nProfession? SW engineer (tech lead)\nWhat is your favourite breakfast? Scrambled eggs/poha/chai paratha\nAre you blocked by lex? I never interacted with anything related to Lex ever I guess, except few podcasts - No\nWhich programming language do you hate? (only for coders) Alright I don\u0026rsquo;t like what is the current state of web dev largely to the credit of framework driven development - he relents - * I think we all know where is pointing to*\nWho is your favourite anime waifu? * I wasn’t really surprised*\nWhat is the secret to your bangers? hard hitting relatable truths make the best bangers imo\nIncel? I\u0026rsquo;m a local LLM-cel I guess.\nFavourite movie? (top 5) Fight club, twelve angry men, Batman: The Dark Knight, Rango, Kimi no na wa\nany 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen? Till I Collapse - Eminem, Feeling Good - Michael Buble, Ghosts - Michael Jackson, Luk Chup Na Jao Ji, Dandalayya - Baahubali\nany kinda sports you follow? I like to follow chess and some top fighters in UFC and whenever there\u0026rsquo;s a good cricket match-up\nFavourite pepe?\nThe last meme that made you chuckle? * I chose this for him* Summary as told by ChatGPT (I asked chatgpt to judge him but chatgpt refused)\nThis person admires Karpathy and Gerganov but remains skeptical. They\u0026rsquo;re a tech lead software engineer who enjoys reading, swimming, and strategy games. Their favorite breakfast is scrambled eggs or poha. They follow chess, UFC fighters, like movies such as \u0026ldquo;Fight Club,\u0026rdquo; and enjoy songs from Eminem and Michael Buble. No judgments are made about them.\nfin.\nA huge thanks to TokenBender (e/xperiments) for taking the time out to answer my questions. He volunteered to give this a chance. HOTPOT wishes him all the best for all his future endeavours and may his LLM models beat all other LLM models.\nTo the moon! 🚀🚀\n"},{

  "content":"This story is not about me but I’ll tell this story as a first person so y’all can suck it!\nI met @cokanestudio on twitter/X when some of my moots started interacting with his posts. Seemed like a friendly fella, he is actually friendly and not hostile as you’d assume controlled substance dealers are. (j/k, he is a code-coolie, like me)\nHe influenced me into buying IEMs, and not only me a lot of people were influenced and most of the TPOT now owns IEMs. I don’t know if he benefitted from that or not. Could’ve.\nAnyway, as mentioned before he is a code-coolie. Nice fella. Same Indian Engineering Story as everyone.\nHe says that he joined to learn tech-y things and followed tech accounts, got fed up with their DSA course posts and created an alt to troll them but ended up making frens. He is a fellow BBIT member and clicks nice photos, I have heard from some of my sources that he runs a photography CBC secretly only for his frens.\nI asked cokane a few questions and he was glad to answer them for us (HOTPOT)\nBasic questionnaire answers:\nWhen did you join? 2021\nHow did you come across tpot? ligmesh and prge Which account do you worship here? vivek Hobbies? spectate e-lafda\nProfession? wagie in a cagie writing webapps\nWhat is your favourite breakfast? intermittent fasting bruv, no breakfast for me\nAre you blocked by lex? no :(\nWhich programming language do you hate? html\nWho is your favourite anime waifu? dejavucoder What is the secret to your bangers? boost\nIncel? 100%\nFavourite movie?

Summary as per ChatGPT:\nThis person appears to have a humorous and somewhat irreverent personality, with interests ranging from niche internet culture to mainstream movies. They also exhibit a sense of adaptability in their social interactions, as their favorite sports depend on the preferences of those they engage with.\nfin.\nI wish @cokanestudio the best for his future endeavours. May the force be with you. Keep posting bangers!\nShoutout to @cokanestudio for taking the time out for answering questions and being a part for the newly formed Humans of TPOT publication. We aren’t popular still cokane ji took out time for us.\nThe questionnaire will keep improving as we go, I promise! For any feedback, my DMs are open.\nTo the moon and beyond! 🚀🚀cokane\nThanks for reading Humans of TPOT publication. Please subscribe for more TPOT related news and humour.
