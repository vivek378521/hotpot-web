I have been thinking about starting to exercise, nothing extreme like going to the gym and pumping iron, just long walks, some cycling. It should be fine. I want to avoid dying from diabetes :P

Anyway, let’s welcome today’s guest, **[@Sam Laki](https://x.com/samlakig?s=20)**

I met Sam on the BBIT gc, he reacts to every message, that is one of the most wholesome things about the lad. He acknowledges, and might laugh at silly jokes too. Given his strength, I find it a bit confusing on how is such a humble lad. I think if you ask him he will readily help you move houses.

He knows a lot of foreign people, I am not sure how. I haven’t asked him. He interacts with a lot of research posts and “study” posts. He doesn’t get involved in politics and e-lafdas. If I had even a quarter of his strength I would straight up become a bully :P
