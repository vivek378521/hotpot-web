Things have been a bit slow on my side. The stock market has been performing well for some days, but I see job losses around, so I am not sure about the state of the economy. I remember 10-12 years ago, I used to go to the vegetable vendor on a scooter. We used to buy vegetables worth 100-150 INR every week, and it would fill the bag. Today, when I go to the vendor and pay him 100 INR, only 1/3rd of the bag gets filled. Prices have risen.

Anyway, this has been long pending, we are here with [**@astronikos**](https://x.com/formrpessimist?s=20) today.

I met Nikos Ji on bbit, and then he shared some of his hacking trauma, and we became friends. Now, I am his self-proclaimed best friend who doesn't even know who he is in real life. But that's fine. We're tight.

He seems to have a penchant for suffering; I think he likes it. Maybe it gives him purpose? I'm not here to psychoanalyse him. He's a good human being who has given me an open invitation to visit his home and play games on his PS5.

Also, he's searching for someone ambitious to marry (or date?). So, if you're an ambitious person ready to mingle, I (HotPot) endorse Astronikos. He has also been going to the gym! What say?
