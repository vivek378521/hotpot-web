Been a long time folks, the ups and downs of running a 200 follower account got to us. One might think that running a 200 followers account might be an easy task but it isn't. You need to think about traction, engagement and all that SEO bs. I never thought that a simple task could be so complex. With a lot of power, comes a lot of responsibility. I have realised that.

We are going back to the basics, featuring more people on the blog. Everything else is just noise. I love doing this and hopefully something good will come out of this.

Anyway, today we have [Darpan](https://x.com/darpanthisside?s=20) ji with us.

He is a pun-tastic person, okay, that's all I know about him. I noticed Darpan ji when he was regularly posting puns on the hell-site (twitter). A lot of them are good. (No disrespecc)

Fame motivates him.

I think I should know more about the person that I am featuring.
