How are you, my dear friends? I am doing alright. Today, I met Toad-sama while I was coming back home from the shop. I also met a lot of puppies. I was sick the past week; I think it's the flu making rounds. When I am sick, I have this habit of giving up on life. So, I didn't really focus on anything, and hotpot got delayed by a huge amount of time. I am sorry for making you all miss me.

Y'all did miss me right?

Anyway, we have a star in our midst today, [@barbie ji](https://x.com/BarbieXhausted?s=20).

I started noticing a glimmer of an exhausted Barbie on the TL when some of my oomfies started interacting with her posts. I thought, "Wow, another catfish account that will probably go bust in a month or so." But then, my TL became Barbie, Barbie because of corporate propaganda by a company.

After some time, we got to listen to Barbie sing and saw some photos, proving the account not to be a catfish. Turns out, Barbie is real; she lives in a tier 1 city and doesn't speak much Hindi. She is a master procrastinator, likes to travel on her terms, and will feed you curd rice because it is the easiest to cook.
