I have been thinking about this a long time, what if we could do whatever we wanted without worrying about money. What would you do? I would read more, write sci-fi novels and interview people.

Anyway, let’s get to our guest for today, **[@DeepknowledgeU](https://x.com/DeepknowledgeU?s=20)**, or more famously known as **Govind**.

He is everywhere, but he is nowhere. He likes semi-conductors and protein. I haven’t interacted much on a personal level with him, only had conversations around infra in India, politics, defence manufacturing. I have seen him involved in muscle maxxing conversations, but I have no interest in gyming so I have nothing to contribute to those discussions.

My thoughts are enclosed in _\*my\_inner\_monologue\*._

18.  how did you decide the username/handle?
    
    **my inspiration is the roots of a tree, you can have shallow / broad roots , that are flimsy**
    
    **(like coconuts)** 
    
    **or deep roots (like Teak) that can withstand centuries and keep growing**
    
    **Trees symbolise slow long term growth, observing the world slowly as it changes around them.  and it is in their calming presence that men often obtain divine knowledge. hence my pfp and handle**
