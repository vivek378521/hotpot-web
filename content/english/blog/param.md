Listening to some songs make you nostalgic, some songs make you sad, some songs makes you happy, some songs make you want to pick up your keyboard smash it on table and then dance while you continue the destruction. Why do songs trigger feelings? Will songs trigger feeling when we build a conscious machine?

Anyway, letâ€™s welcome our guest for today, **[Param](https://x.com/iliekcomputers?s=20).**

I met Param ji on tpot, havenâ€™t interacted much with him, but I feel the whole tpot knows that he is on a sabbatical. He was doing something related to sicp and QR code menus, but now it has been quite some time since I got an update. I played a game he made on his website [adventures.param.codes](https://adventures.param.codes). I think he is enjoying his sabbatical. You get to try a lot of things.

PS - I am not encouraging you to go on a sabbatical. This is not an advice and should anything go wrong you have no right to sue us.

You can understand by his twitter handle that he likes computer. Computers are complex things, humans are complex-er. Maybe some day, Computers will build humans.
