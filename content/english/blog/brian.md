Yesterday, I was pondering how we arrived at this point in life. Countless events became entangled, giving birth to new occurrences. I also realized that it's all just a complex web of interactions involving multiple events triggered by different individuals. So, we find ourselves here due to the actions of various people, including my own, and everything has simply accumulated.

Anyway, today we bring to you, Dr. **[@Brian](https://x.com/BrianAhuja?s=20)** ji! (he is real doctor not phd one :P)

I met Brian Ji in a mutual Twitter group chat, and as always, I started asking silly questions. Not only was he nice enough to answer them all, but he also DMed me, saying that I can ask him questions whenever I want. Even my teachers haven't entertained the idea of their students asking silly questions.

He lives in Las Vegas. Also, he doesn't consume any seed oils. I was blown away when I learned about it.

I normally meet a lot of cool anonymous users on Twitter, but the first genuinely cool person with a profile picture of himself. He used to collect basketball cards when he was a kid. Did I mention that he is a doctor? The Indian shaadi market will go nuts for him.
