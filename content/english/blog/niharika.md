I have no fun anecdotes to share today about my life. It has been pretty bland since a few days. The doggo my family feeds and takes care of has started to follow me everywhere. Anyway.

This is the Diwali Edition ü™î blog, featuring **[Niharika ji](https://x.com/Niharika__rao?s=20)**. I am very happy that she agreed to do this. She once called this initiative wholesome, and that is how this got initiated. We don‚Äôt know much about Niharika ji; previously, I talked to only people I had interacted with. But I remember when threads came out, a few tpot people and I shifted to threads, and I discovered Niharika ji‚Äôs account there. I had seen her on my Twitter timeline before, but she wasn't that integrated with the circle I hang out with. But it became a passing thought because she was on a sabbatical from Twitter.

I think she hangs out with the sophisticated circle of tpot; our circles intersected with 1-2 people in common, but now I don‚Äôt see those 1-2 people around anymore, so now both the circles are different. When I say sophisticated, I mean the people aren‚Äôt that unhinged.

No, I am not treading the line of labeling people elitist. Why do your minds go to places where they shouldn‚Äôt go?

As I said, I don‚Äôt know much about her, and the reason I believe is very apt. One shouldn‚Äôt reveal themselves to total internet strangers, and that is a good policy to follow.

I think she likes to click photos, but photography isn‚Äôt her profession (I guess).

Oh, also: Happy Deepawali, frens!

**Questionnaire**

1.  When did you join?
    
    **Last year in May with little to no intention of interacting with anyone. I joined because I met a person on a trip who was building a network on twitter and I thought that was interesting, because the side of twitter I was exposed to was only political dramas and senseless gossip. I lurked around for a while, until I didn't want to anymore. It was life-changing in certain ways. I am not even exaggerating.**
    
2.  Origin of your username/handle? (iff)
    
    **It‚Äôs just my name, except not exactly. I use a fake last name on all socials so no coworker can find me. That‚Äôs as much anon as I can be. Some on tpot know I am quick to share details about myself, so I keep one element of surprise for the future.**
    
3.  How did you come across tpot?
    
    **The tpot I knew is different from the bbit tpot. One of the first anons I spoke with was @catdaddyissues. It truly was a canon event. I found many more through @rahul\_\_and. Another significant find was @dejavucoder whose first interaction with me was ‚Äúaap boomer ho kya?‚Äù. This boomer found many more on tpot thanks to dejavu.**
    
4.  Which account do you worship here/ fav account?
    
    **@dejavucoder, @cokanestudio**
    
5.  What is your favorite breakfast?
    
    **Anything that is hot and spicy. Sweet and cold breakfasts make no sense to me. Need a hit of spice to wake me up. And a big glass of filter coffee. Scrambled eggs with tabasco, lentil khichdi, rice bath (it is a karnataka thing - hot rice item with ghee poured over it, along with a coconut chutney, ah lord!). Idly-chutney, if I am eating at a hotel. Certain darshinis have watery chutney that they pour over the idlies, like sambhar, and boy that makes me so happy!**
    
6.  A dish you can never get enough of?
    
    **Pesto Pasta with broccoli and sun dried tomatoes. Evergreen favorite. And lately, Shin Ramyun, the instant one. I have been experimenting with all kinds of toppings. It is insanely fun and delicious.**
    
7.  What Lays flavour do you like?
    
    **Chile Limon**
    
8.  Who is your favourite anime waifu/ fav actress/actor?
    
    **No name comes off the top of my head, so none.**
    
9.  What is the secret to your bangers?
    
    **I don‚Äôt think I have any bangers. You should‚Äôve seen the other person (my anon)**
    
10.  Favourite movie? (Any top 5) **- Sigh! I wish I had an answer.**
    
11.  Any 5 go-to songs that you think people should listen to?
    
*   **Cold Little Heart - Michael Kiwanuka**
    
*   **Inside of Love - Nada Surf**
    
*   **Kya Dekhu - Osho Jain**
    
*   **Saturn - Sleeping At Last**
    
*   **Unforgettable - Nat King Cole**
        
12.  Any kinda sports you follow?
    **On and off I follow tennis, that‚Äôs it.**
    
13.  Favourite pepe?
    **This. So fucking stupid, what is this, I love it so much! Also, a majority of tdm and cokane‚Äôs stash.**

14.  The last meme that made you chuckle?
    **I have more saved comics than memes, so this one:**

16.  Can you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities?
    **The amount of support I have received here is unmatched by anything I have ever experienced in my life. Last year my family went through a tough time, and tpot stood for me through it all. A beautiful bunch of strangers-turned-friends holding me through words, through virtual hugs, and in all ways they could think of. It felt surreal to receive so much love. Never once did I feel alone in that fight; the beauty of this soulful community.**
    
17.  A tweet you think is based?
    **Nothing. There has been a lot of noise on the tl lately. People love to provoke, don‚Äôt they?**
    
18.  An image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence?
    **These are what I mark as the essence of my existence, hence mine too.**

We are eternally grateful to **[Niharika ji](https://x.com/Niharika__rao?s=20)** for agreeing to do this. We would like to gift her some hotpot goodies but unfortunately we have none. We wish her all the best for her future endeavours and may she succeed in whatever she decides to do in her life.

Cheers.
