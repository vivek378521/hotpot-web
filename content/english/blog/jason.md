I have been following Kaiju no 8, and I got to say, the plot is cliche, but it is entertaining. We need to understand why cliche is a cliche and still people watch it. I think that it is because the same kind of things entertain us. The fights, the corny humour, the good over evil plot lines are wildly hope inducing.

The best content is rated 6-7 on imdB, anything greater than 8 on imdB is mostly a virtue signalling movie/tv series. If you want entertainment then the song '[Sheila ki Jawani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTmF2v59CtI)' is a better song than any song from the movie 'Lootera'.

But that's just me, you can be an art snob for all I care. :P

Anyway, today we have Jason-sama with us.

We met on a mutual gc, since then I have followed what Jason sama tweets. Cool guy. Runs a company I think. Too honest with his tweets given he is not anon. But that is what we are on twitter for, right? Brutal honesty mixed with satire and humour. He told me that Tim Sweeney is not related to Sydney Sweeney and I am sad now, how can two people with the same surname not be related? I think I need to verify things before spreading misinformation.

If you are in Pondicherry and got lost then do contact him, he will arrange for a rescue.

12. If you had the power to bless a certain animal species with the ability to converse like humans, who’d you pick and why?**  
    **absolutely orcas. high intelligence like us. complex social structure like humans. and pretty much like humans, they also take risks and hunt/kill another apex predator in the sea. great white sharks. so - the king of the oceans talking with the king species of the land will be epic.**

    **Something that heavily inspires me to build and actually share my learnings (which i’ve not yet done, but would like to do so) is cto\_junior’s gdoc and yacine sharing his work. super significant, sometimes i’ve opened my eyes from deep sleep thinking about how effective they’re.**

We hope that Jason ji becomes a real estate developer in Pondicherry and gifts everyone in tpot a flat (2bhk at least). We wish his all the best for all his future endeavours.
