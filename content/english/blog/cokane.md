This story is not about me but Iâ€™ll tell this story as a first person so yâ€™all can suck it!

I met [@cokanestudio](https://x.com/cokanestudio?s=20) on twitter/X when some of my moots started interacting with his posts. Seemed like a friendly fella, he is _actually_ friendly and not hostile as youâ€™d assume controlled substance dealers are. (j/k, he is a code-coolie, like me)

He influenced me into buying IEMs, and not only me a lot of people were influenced and most of the TPOT now owns IEMs. I donâ€™t know if he benefitted from that or not. Couldâ€™ve.

Anyway, as mentioned before he is a code-coolie. Nice fella. Same Indian Engineering Story as everyone.

He says that he joined to learn tech-y things and followed tech accounts, got fed up with their DSA course posts and created an alt to troll them but ended up making frens. He is a fellow BBIT member and clicks nice photos, I have heard from some of my sources that he runs a photography CBC secretly only for his frens.

I asked cokane a few questions and he was glad to answer them for us (HOTPOT)
