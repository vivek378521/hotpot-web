I have been on twitter/X for a while now, I know this story isn’t about me, but I am the one writing it, innit? So you gotta bare with me. Also follow Humans of TPOT.

Yes, so what was I saying? Yes. It has been a while on twitter/X, I went through the trauma of twitter → X transition. Whilst it was painful, something of this sort was bound to happen. We weathered the storm. Enough of my ramblings then, let’s get to the main story now.

Today’s guest is none other than the shining star of tpot, **[@emacsdicksucker](https://x.com/emacsdicksucker?s=20).** He has many personalities but I asked him to be an optimist for this conversation. There are many schizos on twitter but EDS is my favourite, you can some times find him on spaces, enthusiastic fellow with heart full of love for all species.

I have attended spaces where EDS was present, although could never figure out how he was so energetic at night. I won’t ask him to reveal his secret. I hope he enjoyed his 7 cigarettes. (inside joke)
