My stress buster was to roam around the city in vice city in a car and follow traffic rules whilst doing that. Do people do that? But sometimes I also sat in a tank and destroyed the city.

Anyway, our guest for today is, **[@vishwanath](https://x.com/FrozenInRetro?s=20) !**

I had seen Vishwanath Ji frequently on my timeline, but I only interacted with him when he joined a mutual group chat. He is a well-mannered and spiritually inclined individual. Vishwanath owns a gaming PC and enjoys playing a variety of games. Although he claims to be just an average gamer, it's apparent that he plays games purely for fun. He even used a trainer to successfully complete the Vice City RC Helicopter mission.

His top three favourite games are GTA V, Days Gone, and Cyberpunk 2077.

I haven't witnessed him becoming unhinged over silly things on Twitter, but it's possible that he has an alternate account where he expresses a different side of himself. You'll notice that he frequently posts about football and Formula 1. He resides in Bangalore, which can be easily determined by reviewing his tweets.

He has an alt on twitter where he is unhinged. :’)
