I got up early today, because a mouse was making a ruckus and throwing things which were kept above the wardrobe. So I and my mother got up at 4:00 AM, and started chasing the mouse with broom and mop. After some time of brainstorming and blocking the mouse’s tracks, we were successful in my forcing the mouse to the go back the way he came from, that it, to the balcony.

Anyway, let me introduce today’s guest, **[@jbasedos](https://x.com/JBasedos?s=20)!**

I met jeff ji on bbit, one day he appeared, we did not know who he was. But his ideas and ideologies were a fit for bbit. Recently, we have had a small conversation on twitter on how Maggi Atta Noodles are goated. He has a PS5, he has a car, he works in tech, and I think one day he will come back to India, start his own company and employ me as the VP.

Our views on MCU also are synonymous, it has gone downhill. After End Game, it was the End of MCU. His favourite MCU character is Spider-man and I think MCU’s salvation is Spider-man. Everything else is gone. Turned to dust.
