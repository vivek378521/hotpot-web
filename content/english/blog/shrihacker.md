All of you who are wondering what JSK stands for, it is, _**Jai Shri Krishna**_. I am not going to explain the origin.

I started interacting with **[Shri Hacker ji](https://x.com/shrihacker?s=20)** when he gave me advice on how to build my resume, I think he asked me to remove my highschool grade from the resume. Yes, I had high school grades in my resume. Since then I have seen him on the tl a lot more. Some of y’all must have had Shri ji’s Mom’s food. Shri ji has become quite famous on X/twitter.

I have seen him conversing with trolls with utmost respect and decorum. I know he lives in USA and has a dog named Rumi, I love watching Rumi videos on my tl. Here is a photo of Rumi for more engagement:
