Yesterday wasn't such a good day, but today is better, and life seems worth living.

I'm not really sure if labelling a young lad as a 'tpot fboi' will affect his image, but then again, all of this is for fun.

Let me introduce our guest for today, **[@prge](https://x.com/shguke?s=20) !**

Innit?

Just had to do that, sorry.

I've interacted with him on Discord voice chat and heard him hosting spaces. He's a nice lad. I recently broke his trust by spreading disinformation about Bollywood. From what I've gathered talking to him, he's a hardworking person.

His mission is to 'colonize' the UK.

When I interacted with him, it felt like we were already friends. On the contrary, now that I'm thinking about it, I don't know much about him. I saw a video of him dancing, if that counts as getting to know each other.

He has traveled all over India for holidays and vacations, and he enjoys rock climbing. He's also reading 'Jujutsu Kaisen', and that is all I could figure out from his profile on X.

    **Imagining typec like this**
    
18.  Can you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities?
    
    **In terms of impact there might be 2 tbh. The first is how I was a lurker for the longest of time until telt messaged me out of the blue one day and idk why i started tweeting into the void, recently a guy messaged me to lmk how I had told to him to just be chill and talk to people and it had helped him a lot lol. Funny isn't it. Secondly, I think tokenbender’s been very helpful lately just helped a lot to get me back on track. Twitter might be great but its very easy to get absorbed into it.** 
    
19.  A tweet you think is based?
    
    **Everyday is a blank slate that has its bangers.** 
    
20.  An image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence?
