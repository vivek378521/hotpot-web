"Long time no see"

I keep saying this a lot, but I keep coming back here.

I still don't know if I should be writing it as "we" or "I", I am confused.

A long time has passed since we published a blog, I know you have missed me/us. But you shouldn't be sad, I still am an active lurker, I keep an eye on everyone of you. \*wink, wink\*

I have no anecdotes for you today. My present life is quite uneventful but maybe I can tell you a childhood story. When I was a kid, I participated in many fancy dress competitions. One such event I dressed up as a balloon seller. A freakin balloon seller. Astronaut? No. Scientist? No. A balloon seller. My mom painted a moustache on me, I wore a dhoti and a dirty brown kurta and I sold balloons.

I did not win anything.

Anyway today we have with us [Sankalp](https://x.com/dejavucoder) with us (that counts as a win)

I met Sankalp on tpot, good guy. He had a phase of making spectacular GenAI images (lots of beautiful women), now he posts memes and about his GenAI journey. He knows a lot of people on tpot. I interacted with him on a mutual gc, nice kid. He is the second most famous person who we have featured on hotpot (7500+ followers).

I don't think he looks like the pfp he has on twitter.

Questionnaire

1. When did you join tpot?  
    **I joined Twitter in Oct 2021. Back then, I don’t think we had the “tpot” (the bbit group or the bangalore tpot). SF tpot was still there but I didn’t know of it.
