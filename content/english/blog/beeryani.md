We are the result of millions of years of evolution, and here we are, tweeting our lives away. Some days I wonder if everything is going to be done by robots; then, what will we humans do? I will become a writer; I know. I am not sure about what y'all will do.

Maybe we all go back to farming. :')

Anyway, today we have the elusive [@beeryani](https://x.com/beeryaniboi?s=20) with us.

His following-to-follower ratio is mind-boggling: for every person he follows, there are ~9.63 people following him. I wonder what the strategy behind this high conversion is.

I met him on Twitter when I got into BBIT. I remember that he was grinding for his pivot to a dev role, and I was looking for a job. I believe he has left the dev grind, but I think he knows more than some SDEs. :P

He also referred me to the place he worked/works at. I am not an ungrateful person; I have thanked him for that!

Another reason that makes me relate to Beeryani is our mutual love for Kanpur. I think it is Stockholm syndrome, but whateva! :')
