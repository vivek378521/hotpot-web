Today we are going to talk about a human who plays with LLMs (Large Language Models), **[TokenBender (e/xperiments)](https://x.com/4evaBehindSOTA?s=20) .**

Yes, we are going to talk \`about him\` and not \`to him\`.

Yes, I have confirmed his pronoun preference.

So bender ji is my senpai, no not in that kind of way you morons! He is someone whom I have conversed with on discord. We talked about LLMs and everything around it.

Bender senpai created his account in college but wasnâ€™t active until the start of this year. He found many like minded people here and then ended up interacting with schizos. I have never seen him interact with political posts or bait posts, I also believe it is the reason that he has maintained his sanity. he-he-he

So text inside _**\*my inner monologue\***_ is my inner monologue.

Summary as told by ChatGPT (I asked chatgpt to judge him but chatgpt refused)

> This person admires Karpathy and Gerganov but remains skeptical. They're a tech lead software engineer who enjoys reading, swimming, and strategy games. Their favorite breakfast is scrambled eggs or poha. They follow chess, UFC fighters, like movies such as "Fight Club," and enjoy songs from Eminem and Michael Buble. No judgments are made about them.

A huge thanks to **[TokenBender (e/xperiments)](https://x.com/4evaBehindSOTA?s=20)** for taking the time out to answer my questions. He volunteered to give this a chance. HOTPOT wishes him all the best for all his future endeavours and may his LLM models beat all other LLM models.

_To the moon! ðŸš€ðŸš€_
