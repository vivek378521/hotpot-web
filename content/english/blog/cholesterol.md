The year's end is near, and I'm feeling nostalgic. As I write this, my father is playing sad songs on the speaker, making it difficult to conjure anything remotely funny. I don't like odd numbers. I feel that 2024 will be a better year overall. Why are all the sad songs so long? Why do humans have to infuse suffering into lyrics, crafting songs that bring sadness to the surface? What kind of perversion is this?

I am jealous of all people who are happy this new year, fuck y'all!

Anyway, lets welcome [**@Cholesterol**](https://x.com/zadextroyer?s=20)!

I came across Cholesterol ji randomly on the tl, I don't specifically remember how. What I do remember is that was his Bad Cholesterol phase. He is the Head of ODP (Office of disinfo and propaganda) at hotpot. I know where he lives, like the city, not his address. He should be doing more mischief and spreading more disinformation on twitter.
