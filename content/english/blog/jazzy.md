So we are accelerating! I have decided that I will track all the people I have sent links to on Google Sheets and put in reminder dates, and persistently follow up with them until they have filled out the questionnaireâ€”no sitting passively. Yes, we started as a fun initiative, but now we will force people to have fun. \*angy\*

Anyway, let's welcome today's guest, hotpot's Growth VP intern, [**Jazzy**](https://x.com/chaotic_jazzy?s=20)

I met Jazzy on LinkedIn. I think he was the one who suggested logging onto Twitter, and now we're hereâ€”canon event! You folks must have seen that meme, right? It goes like this:

* If my tweet has 100 likes, then Jazzy is one of them.
    
* If my tweet has 1 like, then Jazzy is the one who liked it.
    
* If my tweet has no likes, then Jazzy might be busy, and he will like it when he comes back online.
    

Jazzy also played a significant role in pushing my entry into BBIT. I owe a lot of my Twitter journey to him. I frequently notice Jazzy lurking in the BBIT group chat, although he posts often. I believe he views Twitter as his online journal.

He's one of the most supportive people I've encountered on Twitter.
