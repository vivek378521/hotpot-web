I have realised that when I sleep on time and enjoy undisturbed sleep, I wake up in a better mood. Therefore, I have decided not to take naps during the day.

Please welcome our today’s guest, **[Likitha ji](https://x.com/pseudonymtra?s=20)**.

I had seen her on my timeline many times, so after the hotpot blog gained some traction, I asked her if she’d be interested in being featured. Hers is the account with the highest number of followers that we have featured so far! :P

No, I'm not doing this for attention. I already received validation from my mom when I helped with the Diwali cleaning. The last I heard, Likitha ji was reading romance novels. I believe her standards and expectations of love may have increased. She has travelled around the whole SEA.
