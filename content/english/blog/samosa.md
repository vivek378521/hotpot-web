Before I get to the guest for today, let me tell you about something I saw today, I saw a big frog today, like really big. Can you believe it? Okay, stop I can sense that y‚Äôall don‚Äôt care, anyway lets move on!

Our guest for today is a snacc, presenting **[basked\_samosa](https://x.com/basked_samosa?s=20)!**

I met Samosa ji on, yes, twitter. He co-writes a newsletter: [nibbles.dev](http://nibbles.dev). It is the only newsletter than I read on a regular basis. Samosa ji is also interested in origin of words. My latest surprise was the origin of the word \`kukurmutta\` (‡§ï‡•Å‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡§Æ‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§æ) - mushroom. I won‚Äôt tell you what it is you can find it out on your own.

There are similarities between Samosa ji and me, we both like to write. I feel he is a better writer and I‚Äôd learn from him.

He is a wholesome human and I am glad that I got introduced to him. We both are [cokanestudio](https://x.com/cokanestudio?s=20) stans. I am not sure if Samosa ji can cook a Samosa IRL, but I hope that he can.

My thoughts are encapsulated in \*_<my side monologue>_\*.

    I love this one! A few weeks back I was out cycling in the evening and all of a sudden Lord Indra started a heavy downpour. I waited inside a nearby shop for some time but the rains didn't seem to be stopping anytime soon. So I said, "Screw it, I'll just cycle in the rain." and loved it so much
    
19.  Can you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities?
    
    **It‚Äôs always interesting to get to know the real person behind the PFP. There‚Äôs only so much you can say in 280 characters (not counting the blue tick accounts here hehe). That, combined with the constant urge to put out something - something funny, something banger, something tongue-in-cheek - reveals only a part of a person to you. So it is always a delight when I get to know people beyond my usual twitter timeline. Everything from joining WhatsApp groups and discussing unhinged stuff there, going on Discord Channels and doing VCs for hours talking about what‚Äôs going on in each other‚Äôs lives, actually going forward to meet them in real life, do fun things and explore new places around together, these all are very memorable for me. I have found some really good folks here.**
