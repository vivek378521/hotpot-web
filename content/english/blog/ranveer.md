Did I tell you about the huge frog? Oh, yes, I did. I have been feeling a little off, maybe it is because of the sudden change in the weather, maybe viral is approaching. I cannot pin the reason, maybe I‚Äôm still fuzzy because of the anti-allergic I took yesterday night because my nose was stuffy. Anyway, let‚Äôs move on!

Today‚Äôs guest is none other than, **[Ranveer](https://x.com/ranveer2252?s=20)!**

So yes Ranveer, I met Ranveer on, well, twitter. He was tweeting about freelancing and stuff, so I DM-ed him. We talked about how to set up your accounts on fiverr/upwork, get freelance work, make your profile awesome and earn moolah.

Ranveer is a CPA, that much is written on his profile, duh. Lively fellow, interested in women, I think he is inclined towards Lahori Kudis. How do I know this? He has said this several times on a GC.

Texts in _\*<my inner monologue>\*_ is my inner monologue.
