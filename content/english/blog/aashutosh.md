Happy New Year frens.

We had a good year overall. We featured cool people on our blog, went through some dry spells and lows, but we emerged strong. Y'all have been too kind to us, and we are eternally grateful for that. We will continue to give our best to the initiative; all we need is your support and blessings.

Today we have with us [**@Aashutosh**](https://x.com/AashutoshRathi?s=20) ji

I met Aashutosh ji through the Nibble Mafia. He and Samosa ji together write for [nibbles.dev](http://nibbles.dev), and they recently completed the 40th edition. I enjoy reading their newsletter. Y'all should subscribe too.

Some of the best people I've met on TPOT have been nodes in a network graph—very cool people with shared interests and kindness. It's always a pleasure to meet fellow writers. One vibes better with people of similar mentality.

I also feel for Aashutosh ji because he will always be Roll No. 1 :')
