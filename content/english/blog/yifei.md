For the past few months, I have been fascinated by burgers. I eat burgers whenever I go to the city (I live 40km away from the city). I have become so obsessed that I have started trying burgers from different burger joints. Although there is not much variety when it comes to vegetarian burgers, I am also lactose intolerant, so I cannot digest burgers with dairy overload. Do you like burgers?

My obsession knows no bounds; I have tried various vada pavs as well. I am not sure why there has been a sudden increase in my intake of bread.

But I also think that burgers are good. If you have watched that anime where the protagonist has a friend who is obsessed with burgers, I am having a hard time remembering the name, my obsession mirrors that friend's obsession with burgers. LOL.

Now I remember: 'Blood Blockade Battlefront'. Below is a shot from a scene.

I see yifei senpai interacting with other anime pfp anons and since then I have followed him. He lives in Japan, you can gather that from his tweets. I think he likes Shibuya. If I ever visit Japan, I am gonna meet him for sure. He likes a cheeseburger.

1. When did you join tpot?  
    **I joined maybe April 2023, before then I was just using Twitter to follow JP artists, then I started following AK for ml paper news and started interacting in the replies. Before I knew it I was in TPOT. Then I decided to start a small meetup called meetmeinshibuya and met a lot of mutuals, which was very fun.**
    
2. Origin of your username/handle? (iff)  
    **Back when I played this CS clone called CrossFire there was a clan called 'fever' or something that I joined and I became yifever.**
    
3. Which account do you worship here/ fav account?  
    **In the early days I used interact a lot with yacine, but now I like @teortaxesTex ‘s vibes the best.**
    
4. Hobbies?  
    **Don’t have that many hobbies now, but I used to do vocaloid music production, and general music stuff a lot. Now I just go gym like everyone else, and hang out with people at Izakayas. Still trying to study Japanese whenever I have time but I don’t have that much free time these days.**
    
5. Profession?  
    **Doing freelance frontend work + working on a Startup in Japan (still in progress). Not much I can say about it at the moment.**
    
6. What is your favourite breakfast?  
    **My favourite breakfast is pretty basic. I get a toast of bread, spread some strawberry jam on it, and have it with milk. I buy about 3-4 days of fresh bread at a time (they have small package sizes in Japan) and it’s very good.**
    
7. A dish you can never get enough of?  
    **I’m a big ramen fan but I know it’s not technically great food. Chicken ramen, pork broth, etc.**
    
8. If you had the chance to bring back a snack/candy from the past that has disappeared from the market, what would you revive?  
    **I didn’t have too much candy growing up but I wish just getting a pack of peanuts as a snack were more normalized. Like just a small kitkat sized package with many a dozen peanuts inside.**
    
9. Who is your favourite anime waifu/ fav actress/actor?  
    **My favourite anime character varies from season to season, but if I had to pick one as the OG it has to be Hakase from Nichijou (2011). It’s a pretty old show but everyone who knows about it has very fond memories of it. It’s kinda like the last of a genre of shows with cute girls doing wacky stuff, like Azumanga Daioh style goofy stuff.**

10. What is the secret to your bangers?  
    **I don’t really post bangers, I just get lucky. The algorithm currently favors posts that are meta-ironic in nature (aka bait), but I try not to post that too much.**
    
11. If you had the power to bless a certain animal species with the ability to converse like humans, who’d you pick and why?  
    **I would bless the dogs because they are super chill and would probably have nothing but good words to say. But then again there is a chance that if they understood human speech we can teach them concepts like death and make them depressed. I’ll say dogs nevertheless.**
    
12. If you had to impress someone by showing them 5 movies, which ones would you pick?
    
    * **Infernal Affairs (2002 Hong Kong film): this one is a banger, peak cinema**
        
    * **3 Idiots (2009 Indian film): good vibes**
        
    * **5 centimetres per second (2007 Japanese anime film): OG Makoto Shinkai love story**
        
    * **Oppenheimer: this one I can actually talk about the physics to impress the other person**
        
    * **LotR trilogy: I know a lot about the lore on this one too**
        
13. If you were to go to a place with no connectivity and you could choose only 5 songs to take with you on a device, which ones would you choose?  
    **Not sure about this one. I get tired of songs real fast. Right now it would be**
    
    * **Plastic Love by Friday Night Plans (Yeah this is a cover)**
        
    * **Strobe by Deadmau5**
        
    * **Sugar with Dua Lipa by BROCKHAMPTON**
        
    * **Giant steps (any version tbh).**
        
    * **Ultralight beam by Ye**
        
    
    **These songs are all kinda random, but all kinda timeless classics to me. (Actually thought pretty hard about this.)**
    
14. any kinda sports you follow?  
    **I used to follow a lot of baseball but now not really. Follow DOTA2 esports still.**
    
15. Favourite pepe / fictional internet celebrity?  
    **There is this Japanese account called 月曜が近いよbot that posts this “Monday is coming” song every Sunday and I think that’s pretty cool.**
    
16. The last meme that made you chuckle?

    **This image that’s a meme of a gacha game I’ve been playing**
    
17. Can you share a memorable moment or story from your time in the TPOT community that had a significant impact on you, without disclosing specific names or identities?  
    **There’s a lot of them. I met a lot of my mutuals irl through my meetup. It’s amazing how people show up just because you posted something. The AI waifu hackathon I posted was also a great event and I got a lot of support form the community.**
    
18. A tweet you think is based?  
    [https://x.com/yifever/status/1731500872251977866](https://x.com/yifever/status/1731500872251977866)

    **This was me at my most schizo and I’ve been chasing that energy ever since.**
    
19. An image from your camera roll that you think captures your essence?

**This type of energy.**

20. If AGI and robots were to take up all the jobs in the world and humans would be left with the choice of doing whatever they want, what would you choose to do and why?  
    **I would probably learn to draw. Or do some giant world-building writing. Or learn to do music production better. There are too many things I want to do, but if there’s 0 opportunity cost then I would go ham.**
    
21. What is a conspiracy theory you are enthusiastic about?  
    **Not a conspiracy theory, but I do think about G sometimes. (G as in a general measure of intelligence). @cremieuxrecueil posts about this sometimes. It’s a deep rabbit hole so I won’t go into it too much, and it also gets political.**
    
22. If you got stranded at an island and a genie appeared and asked you for a wish, what would you wish for? (you cannot ask for more wishes)  
    **Bring me to Showa Japan so I can stop the Plaza Accord.**
    
23. Who is your tpot bestie?  
    **There’s too many LOL. Small account but maybe @PercivalPerrins (I do not endorse his tweets at all BTW just to cover my bases). He helped out a lot during the AI waifu hackathon.**
    
24. If you got a chance to travel the world with a random person from the internet, who’d you pick?
    
    **I would pick someone hot. So I cannot say the real answer. For a fake answer maybe @amix011 I love amix he is very chill**
