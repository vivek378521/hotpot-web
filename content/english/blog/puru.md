Things have been a little slow here, not because of our Chief Editor's subpar selling skills. Just kidding. We cannot blame him for the sluggishness; there is no incentive for anyone to do this. Until now, we have only featured people who were his friends and incredibly kind. Perhaps we need some changes, but we don't know what those changes are. Rest assured, we are working hard to sort things out.

Anyway, today's guest is [Puru](https://x.com/hey_puru?s=20).

We don't know much about Puru, apart from the fact that it is a wholesome cat account. You know, cats and wholesomeness—seems like an odd pairing. :P

We adore cats. Our initial interaction with Puru was through Miaow's tweets, observing Puru lurking around on tpot. Puru brings positive vibes to tpot and it is important for those vibes to prevail.
