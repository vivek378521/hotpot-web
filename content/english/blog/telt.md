I think a polarised world will work in the benefit of human society because people will see how ridiculous the extreme opinions are and then people will start floating over the centre. I am just putting out this idea, I don’t know if it makes sense.

Anyway, today I bring **[Telt](https://x.com/twofifteenam?s=20)** senpai to all y’all. He is the co-founder for BBIT and a human being with a mesmerising chad voice.

I interacted with Telt senpai in a GC and on a discord channel. Everyone at BBIT is a telt senpai voice stan.

Honestly, I don’t know much about telt senpai. I have realised this while writing. I don’t know the reason for it. He seems to be friends with a lot of people on tpot. I have seen his tweet replies across all accounts on tpot. But the thing is I don’t have much to say.

Oh yes, he ran/runs a BBIT grant, the grant was to provide monetary assistance to projects. I also remember that he and a few BBIT folks sponsored a prize at some hackathon. He is an indie Philanthropist? I don’t know how to label this. He he he.

2.  Which account do you worship here/ fav account? **Fav accs cause I found them first and loved the vibes: @DebadreeC, @cto\_junior, @beeryaniboi and @dejavucoder. But there’s just way too many amazing anons that I’ve met irl or in various GCs.**

9.  What is the secret to your bangers? **I feel like I got mostly lucky. It’s a combination of figuring out the current thing and making a joke about it but my bangers are not even close to being Bangers.
