You might have read the tweets where I mentioned that things have been slow here, slower than usual. But rest assured, I am working on it and will make sure the Hotpot blog doesn’t run into stagnancy.

Anyway, let’s get to today’s guest, the most handsomest person alive, **[@DebadreeC](https://x.com/DebadreeC?s=20)**

[![Image](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/116abaef-0a83-49d3-865a-27b7cf1381ae_400x400.jpeg "Image")](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F116abaef-0a83-49d3-865a-27b7cf1381ae_400x400.jpeg)

Do you notice the killer expression, no doubt his DMs are flooded with e-girls!

I first interacted with Deba on bbit, he is a friendly bengali bloke, there were times when he was active on twitter/X but I think now he has got more responsibilities at workplace so he is little less active now or maybe I don’t see him on my tl.

He is the Group HR at BBIT, being in WB he has political connections that help him gain a stronghold in the district he lives in. Just kidding. He is a Modiji fan, like me.

My thoughts are _\*mentioned\_here\*._
